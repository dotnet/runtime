    # The ref/ directories don't contain shipping implementations of code, so they should
    # be excluded from analysis. If there is a problem at the API layer, the analysis
    # engine will detect the problem in the src/ implementations anyway.

    # exclude artifacts/obj/**/CMakeFiles/**/CheckFunctionExists.c since CMake 
    # generates random directory names causing creation of duplicate issues 
    # related to obsolete encryption algorithm used. Note that CheckFuntionExists 
    # files are generated as part of build-time checks in CMake and are not compiled
    # or linked into any product binaries.
