# For CI typical usage is
#
# ./install-native-dependencies.sh <OS> <arch> azDO
#
# For developer use it is not recommended to include the azDO final argument as that
# makes installation and configuration setting only required for azDO
#
# So simple developer usage would currently be

# ./install-native-dependencies.sh <OS>
