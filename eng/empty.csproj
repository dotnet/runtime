  <!-- This project exists purely to work around Arcade
       behavior. Arcade knows how to restore tasks needed for
       publishing to blob feeds, but it requires a project file that
       imports nuget restore targets to be specified for this to
       work. See details in
       https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/f657be5cb7cd4920334dd9162173b131211a1e17#r31728598.
