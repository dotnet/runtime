;; Exclusions for SignCheck. Corresponds to info in Signing.props.
;; Format: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/397316e195639450b6c76bfeb9823b40bee72d6d/src/SignCheck/Microsoft.SignCheck/Verification/Exclusion.cs#L23-L35
;;
;; This issue tracks a way to implement exclusions via Signing.props and avoid this extra file: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/2888

;; The apphost and comhost are template files, modified by the SDK to produce the executable for FDE
;; and SCD apps. If they are signed, the file that the SDK produces has an invalid signature and
;; can't be signed again. More info at https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/pull/7549.
