# This pipeline includes the platforms that we don't have resources to run on every PR but that we want
# to still have test coverage, we run this pipeline on a schedule and also developers can run it
# via /azp run command on PRs. This pipeline permits us to have the main runtime pipeline run the same
# platforms in PRs and Scheduled builds.

# Setting batch to true, triggers one build at a time.
# if there is a push while a build in progress, it will wait,
# until the running build finishes, and produce a build with all the changes
# that happened during the last build.
