# This pipeline is for staging Apple Silicon testing
#
# The Apple Silicon queues have limited capacity so we do not watn them
# enabled for all PRs.
#
# This pipeline is configured to get rolling builds so we get some
# regular Apple Silicon test coverage
#
# This queue is intended to run tests until they are stabilized and can
# be moved into normal
#
# This pipeline is also used for Apple Silicon developrs to trigger
# testing their own PRs
#
# pipeline is confgured to rolling build
# Can also be triggered using /azp trigger

# Setting batch to true, triggers one build at a time.
# if there is a push while a build in progress, it will wait,
# until the running build finishes, and produce a build with all the changes
# that happened during the last build.
