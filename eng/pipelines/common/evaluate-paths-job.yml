### Job used to evaluate changed paths on a pull request to emit variables to condition jobs based on paths.

parameters:
  # Object containing subset include and exclude paths in an array form.
  # Scenarios:
  #  1. exclude paths are specified
  #     Will include all paths except the ones in the exclude list.
  #  2. include paths are specified
  #     Will only include paths specified in the list.
  #  3. exclude + include:
  #     1st we evaluate changes for all paths except ones in excluded list. If we can't find
  #     any applicable changes like that, then we evaluate changes for included paths
  #     if any of these two finds changes, then a variable will be set to true.
  #  In order to consume this variable you need to reference it via: $[ dependencies.evaluate_paths.outputs['SetPathVars_<subset>.containschange'] ]
  #
  #  Array form example
  #  paths:
  #  - subset: coreclr
  #    include:
  #    - src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/*
  #    exclude:
  #    - src/libraries/*
  #
  #  This example will include ALL path changes under src/libraries/ except the ones under src/libraries/*!System.Private.CoreLib/*
