    Import projects for Arcade to build.

    The imported file supports the '/p:Subset=<desired subset string>' dev build argument.

    Each subset has its own '<subset>ProjectToBuild' items so that a project in the build can depend
    on a whole subset, and the dependency on the subset is disregarded automatically when Subset
    doesn't contain it.

    %(ProjectToBuild.SignPhase): Indicates this project must be built before a certain signing
      phase. Projects can depend on 'signing/stages/Sign<stage>.proj' to wait until all projects
      that are part of a stage are complete. This allows the build to perform complex container
      signing that isn't (can't be?) supported by Arcade's single pass, such as MSIs and bundles:

  <!--
    Use this extensibility point to build custom tasks during Build.proj, before any restoring or
    building happens in the repo. These DLLs would ideally live in Arcade and be restored as tools,
    so the idea is building them here is somewhat equivalent.

    Also create the host RID props file so the main build can use it statically.

    Use synthetic inputs/outputs to avoid building it all the time. This should let devs build with
    MSBuild node reuse enabled (the Arcade default). If it were built every time, it would hit file
    locking issues vs. the persistent nodes that loaded the task DLL for the previous build. It
    isn't particularly accurate, but better than nothing.
