- All

* All docs refer to the build.sh script with the subset and configuration.
* All docs include the libs subset in their instructions.
* All docs mention the possibility to omit explicitly typing -subset for the first
  argument to the script.
* Only Mono talks about generating the Nuget packages, but this actually applies
  to all of them.
* CoreCLR and Libraries talk about working with VS. Mono doesn't.
