Issue Guide
===========

Core-setup uses the [CoreFx policies](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/issue-guide.md), so use that for general information on how to create an issue, etc.

### Areas
Areas are tracked by labels area-&#42; (e.g. area-Host). To view owners for each area in this repository check out the [area-owners.md](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/area-owners.md) page.
