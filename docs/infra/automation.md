## Automation

### Fabric Bot

This repository uses Fabric Bot to automate issue and pull request management. All automation rules are defined in the [`.github/fabricbot.json`](.github/fabricbot.json) file.

At this moment Fabric Bot has not published a JSON schema for the configuration format. In order to make changes to the configuration file, you should use the [`Fabric Bot portal`](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/) to load the configuration file via the "Import Configuration" option and make changes using the editor. You need to be signed out from the portal in order for this option to appear.
