David Broman's Profiling Blog Archive
===========================

David Broman was the original author of many profiler features in desktop .NET. At the time he had many helpful blog posts, and even today are some of the most thorough documentation we have available on how to use the profiling APIs. They are starting to show their age a bit, and only talk about desktop .NET since they were written before .NET Core existed. However they are still largely accurate and a valuable source of documentation for the profiling APIs.

His blog is being retired, so the relevant profiler articles have been ported here. Ideally we (the profiler team) will work over time to translate them from blog posts to official documentation, and update the crufty bits at the same time, until that happens they are here in an as is state with the knowledge that some parts are out of date.
