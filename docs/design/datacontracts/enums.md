# Enums

There are several enums that the cDAC depends on the values of. These are to be commented in the native code; anyone who tries to change the numerical value of these enums should see these comments and know to version the cDAC. The comments start with `[cDAC] [<Contract Name>]` so that they can be easily searched by contract name.
