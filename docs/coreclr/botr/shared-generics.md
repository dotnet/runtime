Shared Generics Design
===

Author: Fadi Hanna - 2019

# Introduction

Shared generics is a runtime+JIT feature aimed at reducing the amount of code the runtime generates for generic methods of various instantiations (supports methods on generic types and generic methods). The idea is that for certain instantiations, the generated code will almost be identical with the exception of a few instructions, so in order to reduce the memory footprint, and the amount of time we spend jitting these generic methods, the runtime will generate a single special canonical version of the code, which can be used by all compatible instantiations of the method.

More information on the design can be found in the original MSR paper at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/design-and-implementation-of-generics-for-the-net-common-language-runtime.

### Canonical Codegen and Generic Dictionaries

Consider the following C# code sample:

``` c#
string Func<T>()
{
    return typeof(List<T>).ToString();
}
```

Without shared generics, the code for instantiations like `Func<object>` or `Func<string>` would look identical except for one single instruction: the one that loads the correct TypeHandle of type `List<T>`:
``` asm
    mov rcx, type handle of List<string> or List<object>
    call ToString()
    ret
```

With shared generics, the canonical code will not have any hard-coded versions of the type handle of List<T>, but instead looks up the exact type handle either through a call to a runtime helper API, or by loading it up from the *generic dictionary* of the instantiation of Func<T> that is executing. The code would look more like the following:
``` asm
    mov rcx, generic context                                                // MethodDesc of Func<string> or Func<object>
    mov rcx, [rcx + offset of InstantiatedMethodDesc::m_pPerInstInfo]       // This is the generic dictionary
    mov rcx, [rcx + dictionary slot containing type handle of List<T>]
    call ToString()
    ret
```

The generic context in this example is the InstantiatedMethodDesc of `Func<object>` or `Func<string>`. The generic dictionary is a data structure used by shared generic code to fetch instantiation-specific information. It is basically an array where the entries are instantiation-specific type handles, method handles, field handles, method entry points, etc... The "PerInstInfo" fields on MethodTable and InstantiatedMethodDesc structures point at the generic dictionary structure for a generic type and method respectively.

In this example, the generic dictionary for Func<object> will contain a slot with the type handle for type List<object>, and the generic dictionary for Func<string> will contain a slot with the type handle for type List<string>.

This feature is currently only supported for instantiations over reference types because they all have the same size/properties/layout/etc... For instantiations over primitive types or value types, the runtime will generate separate code bodies for each instantiation.


# Layouts and Algorithms

### Dictionaries Pointers on Types and Methods

The dictionary used by any given generic method is pointed at by the `m_pPerInstInfo` field on the `InstantiatedMethodDesc` structure of that method. It's a direct pointer to the contents of the generic dictionary data.

On generic types, there's an extra level of indirection: the 'm_pPerInstInfo' field on the `MethodTable` structure is a pointer to a table of dictionaries, and each entry in that table is a pointer to the actual generic dictionary data. This is because types have inheritance, and derived generic types inherit the dictionary pointers of their base types. 

Here's an example:
```c#
class BaseClass<T> { }

class DerivedClass<U> : BaseClass<U> { }

class AnotherDerivedClass : DerivedClass<string> { }
```

The MethodTables of each of these types will look like the following:

| **BaseClass[T]'s MethodTable**                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ...                                                   |
| `m_PerInstInfo`: points at dictionary table below     |
| ...                                                   |
| `dictionaryTable[0]`: points at dictionary data below |
| `BaseClass's dictionary data here`                    |

| **DerivedClass[U]'s MethodTable **                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ...                                                            |
| `m_PerInstInfo`: points at dictionary table below              |
| ...                                                            |
| `dictionaryTable[0]`: points at dictionary data of `BaseClass` |
| `dictionaryTable[1]`: points at dictionary data below          |
| `DerivedClass's dictionary data here`                          |

| **AnotherDerivedClass's MethodTable**                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ...                                                               |
| `m_PerInstInfo`: points at dictionary table below                 |
| ...                                                               |
| `dictionaryTable[0]`: points at dictionary data of `BaseClass`    |
| `dictionaryTable[1]`: points at dictionary data of `DerivedClass` |

Note that `AnotherDerivedClass` doesn't have a dictionary of its own given that it is not a generic type, but inherits the dictionary pointers of its base types.

### Dictionary Slots

As described earlier, a generic dictionary is an array of multiple slots containing instantiation-specific information. When a dictionary is initially allocated for a certain generic type or method, all of its slots are initialized to NULL, and are lazily populated on demand as code executes (see: `Dictionary::PopulateEntry(...)`).

The first N slots in an instantiation of N arguments are always going to be the type handles of the instantiation type arguments (this is kind of an optimization as well). The slots that follow contain instantiation-based information.

For instance, here is an example of the contents of the generic dictionary for our `Func<string>` example:

| `Func<string>'s dicionary`           |
|--------------------------------------|
| slot[0]: TypeHandle(`string`)        |
| slot[1]: Total dictionary size       |
| slot[2]: TypeHandle(`List<string>`)  |
| slot[3]: NULL (not used)             |
| slot[4]: NULL (not used)             |

Note: the size slot is never used by generic code, and is part of the dynamic dictionary expansion feature. More on that below.

When this dictionary is first allocated, only slot[0] is initialized because it contains the instantiation type arguments (and of course the size slot after the dictionary expansion feature), but the rest of the slots (example slot[2]) are NULL, and get lazily populated with values if we ever hit a code path that attempts to use them.

When loading information from a slot that is still NULL, the generic code will call one of these runtime helper functions to populate the dictionary slot with a value:
- `JIT_GenericHandleClass`: Used to lookup a value in a generic type dictionary. This helper is used by all instance methods on generic types.
- `JIT_GenericHandleMethod`: Used to lookup a value in a generic method dictionary. This helper used by all generic methods, or non-generic static methods on generic types.

When generating shared generic code, the JIT knows which slots to use for the various lookups, and the kind of information contained in each slot using the help of the `DictionaryLayout` implementation (https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/vm/genericdict.cpp).

### Dictionary Layouts

The `DictionaryLayout` structure is what tells the JIT which slot to use when performing a dictionary lookup. This `DictionaryLayout` structure has a couple of important properties:
- It is shared accross all compatible instantiations of a certain type of method. In other words, a dictionary layout is associated with the canonical instantiation of a type or a method. For instance, in our example above, `Func<object>` and `Func<string>` are compatible instantiations, each with their own **separate dictionaries**, however they all share the **same dictionary layout**, which is associated with the canonical instantiation `Func<__Canon>`.
- The dictionaries of generic types or methods have the same number of slots as their dictionary layouts. Note: historically before the introduction of the dynamic dictionary expansion feature, the generic dictionaries could be smaller than their layouts, meaning that for certain lookups, we had to use invoke some runtime helper APIs (slow path).

When a generic type or method is first created, its dictionary layout contains 'unassigned' slots. Assignments happen as part of code generation, whenever the JIT needs to emit a dictionary lookup sequence. This assignment happens during the calls to the `DictionaryLayout::FindToken(...)` APIs. Once a slot has been assigned, it becomes associated with a certain signature, which describes the kind of value that will go in every instantiatied dictionary at that slot index.

Given an input signature, slot assignment is performed with the following algorithm:

```
Begin with slot = 0
Foreach entry in dictionary layout
    If entry.signature != NULL
        If entry.signature == inputSignature
            return slot
        EndIf
    Else
        entry.signature = inputSignature
        return slot
    EndIf
    slot++
EndForeach
```

So what happens when the above algorithm runs, but no existing slot with the same signature is found, and we're out of 'unassigned' slots? This is where the dynamic dictionary expansion kicks in to resize the layout by adding more slots to it, and resizing all dictionaries associated with this layout.

# Dynamic Dictionary Expansion

### History

Before the dynamic dictionary expansion feature, dictionary layouts were organized into buckets (a linked list of fixed-size `DictionaryLayout` structures). The size of the initial layout bucket was always fixed to some number which was computed based on some heuristics for generic types, and always fixed to 4 slots for generic methods. The generic types and methods also had fixed-size generic dictionaries which could be used for lookups (also known as "fast lookup slots").

When a bucket gets filled with entries, we would just allocate a new `DictionaryLayout` bucket, and add it to the list. The problem however is that we could not resize the generic dictionaries of types or methods, because they had already been allocated with a fixed size, and the JIT does not support generating instructions that could indirect into a linked-list of dictionaries. Given that limitation, we could only lookup a generic dictionary for a fixed number of values (the ones associated with the entries of the first `DictionaryLayout` bucket), and were forced to go through a slower runtime helper for additional lookups. This implementation design is from the time of fragile NGen images, and having expandable dictionary structures would have been very complicated.

When the [ReadyToRun](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/readytorun-overview.md) and the Tiered Compilation technologies were introduced, some performance problems started to show. Dictionary slots were getting assigned quickly when used by ReadyToRun code, and when the runtime decided to re-jit certain methods for better performance, it could not in some cases find any remaining "fast lookup slots", and was forced to generate code that goes through the slower runtime helpers. This ended up hurting performance in some scenarios, and a decision was made to not use the fast lookup slots for ReadyToRun code, and instead keep them reserved for re-jitted code. This decision however hurt the ReadyToRun performance, but it was a necessary compromise since we cared more about re-jitted code throughput over R2R throughput.

For this reason, the dynamic dictionary expansion feature was introduced.

### Description

The feature is simple in concept: change dictionary layouts from a linked list of buckets into dynamically expandable arrays instead. Sounds simple, but great care had to be taken when impementing it, because:
- We can't just resize `DictionaryLayout` structures alone. If the size of the layout is larger than the size of the actual generic dictionary, this would cause the JIT to generate indirection instructions that do not match the size of the dictionary data, leading to access violations.
- We can't just resize generic dictionaries on types and methods:
    - They were already allocated with a fixed number of slots, and cannot be resized in place.
    - They can be in use by some generic code.
- We can't just resize the generic dictionary for a single instantiation. For instance, in our example above, let's say we wanted to expand the dictionary for `Func<string>`. The resizing of the layout would have an impact on the shared canonical code that the JIT generates for `Func<__Canon>`. If we only resized the dictionary of `Func<string>`, the shared generic code would work for that instantiation only, but when we attempt to use it with another instantiation like `Func<object>`, the jitted instructions would no longer match the size of the dictionary structure, and would cause access violations.
- The runtime is multithreaded, which adds to the complexity.

### Expansion Algorithm

##### Step 1 - Type and Method Registration

The first step in this feature is to insert all generic types and methods with dictionaries into a hashtable, where the key is the canonical instantiation. For instance, with our example, `Func<string>` and `Func<object>` would be added to the hashtable as values under the `Func<__Canon>` key. This ensures that if we ever need to resize the dictionary layout, we would have a way of finding all existing instantiations to resize their dictionaries as well (remember, a dictionary size has to match the size of the layout now). This is achieved by calls to the `Module::RecordTypeForDictionaryExpansion_Locked` and `Module::RecordMethodForDictionaryExpansion_Locked` APIs, every time a new generic type or method is created, just before they get published for usage by other threads.

##### Step 2 - Dictionary Layout Expansion

Resizing of the dictionary layouts takes place in `DictionaryLayout::ExpandDictionaryLayout`. A new `DictionaryLayout` structure is allocated with a larger size, and the contents of the old layout are copied over. At this point, we **cannot yet** associate that new layout with the canonical instantiation: we need to resize the dictionaries of all related instantiations (because of multi-threading).

##### Step 3 - Type and Method Dictionaries Expansion

Resizing of the dictionaries of all related types or methods takes place in `Module::ExpandTypeDictionaries_Locked` and `Module::ExpandMethodDictionaries_Locked`. New dictionaries are allocated for each affected type or method, and the contents of their old dictionaries are copied over. These new dictionaries then get published on the corresponding `MethodTable` or `InstantiatedMethodDesc` structures (the "PerInstInfo" field). Great care is taken to perform all the dictionary allocations and initializations first before publishing them, with a call to `FlushProcessWriteBuffers()` in the middle to ensure correct ordering of read/write operations in multi-threading.

One thing to note is that old dictionaries are not deallocated, but once a new dictionary gets published on a MethodTable or MethodDesc, any subsequent dictionary lookup by generic code will make use of that newly allocated dictionary. Deallocating old dictionaries would be extremely complicated, especially in a multi-threaded environment, and won't give any useful benefit.

##### Step 4 - Publishing New Dictionary Layout

Finally, after resizing all generic dictionaries, the last step is to publish the newly allocated `DictionaryLayout` structure by associating it with the canonical instantiation.

##### Note on Thread Synchronization

Thread synchronization is done by protecting all places where dictionaries are read/written in a meaninful way using a critical section implementation:
``` c++
CrstHolder ch(&SystemDomain::SystemModule()->m_DictionaryCrst);
```

Here is the list of places that require synchronization:
- Before recording any new generic type or method into hashtable to track them for dictionary expansions (`RecordTypeForDictionaryExpansion_Locked` and `RecordMethodForDictionaryExpansion_Locked`). This prevents any expansion from taking place on another thread before we get a chance to add the type/method into the hashtable and track them.
- Before any unassigned slot in a DictionaryLayout structure gets assigned a certain lookup kind/signature (see `DictionaryLayout::FindToken` implementations). No two threads are allowed to update a DictionaryLayout structure at the same time.
- Before any uninitialized dictionary slot gets populated with a value as a result of a dictionary lookup (see `Dictionary::PopulateEntry`). This is because during expansion, the contents of an existing dictionary are copied over to the newly allocated one, so the lock synchronizes read and write operations.

### Diagnostics

During feature development, an interesting set of bugs were hit, all having to do with multi-threaded executions. The main root cause behind these bugs was that some threads started to make use of newly allocated generic MethodTables or MethodDescs, and started to expand their dictionary layouts before we ever got a chance to insert these new types/methods into the hashtable to correctly track them for dictionary resizing. In other words, some thread was still in the process of constructing these MethodTables/MethodDescs, got them to a usable state and published them, making them available for other threads to start using, but did not yet reach the point of recording them into the hashtable of dictionary expansion tracking. The effect is that some shared generic code started accessing slots beyond the size limits of the generic dictionaries of these types/methods, causing access violations.

The most useful piece of data that made it easy to diagnose these access violations was a pointer in each dynamically allocated dictionary to its predecessor. Tracking back dictionaries using these pointers led to the location in memory where the incorrect lookup value was loaded from, and helped root cause the bug.

These predecessor pointers are allocated at the begining of each dynamically allocated dictionary, but are not part of the dictionary itself (so think of it as slot[-1]). 

The plan is to also add an SOS command that could help diagnose dictionary contents accross the chain of dynamically allocated dictionaries (dotnet/diagnostics#588).
