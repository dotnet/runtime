Get the .NET Core DNX SDK on Linux
==================================

These instructions will lead you through acquiring the .NET Core DNX SDK via the [.NET Version Manager (DNVM)](https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm)  and running a "Hello World" demo on Linux. The instructions use a particular set of paths. You'll need to adjust if you want to use a different set.

These instructions are for .NET Core console apps. If you want to try out ASP.NET 5 on top of .NET Core - which is a great idea - check out the [ASP.NET 5 instructions](https://github.com/aspnet/home).

.NET Core NuGet packages and the .NET Core DNX SDKs are available on the [ASP.NET 'vnext' myget feed](https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext), which you can more easily view on [gallery](https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnetvnext) for the feed.

You can also [build from source](../building/linux-instructions.md). 

Environment
===========

These instructions are written assuming the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, since that's the distro the team uses. Pull Requests are welcome to address other environments as long as they don't break the ability to use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Packages
--------

Install the `libunwind8`, `libssl-dev` and `unzip` packages:

	sudo apt-get install libunwind8 libssl-dev unzip

You also need a latest version of Mono, which is required for DNU. This is a temporary requirement.

	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
	echo "deb http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian wheezy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-xamarin.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install mono-complete

Certificates
------------

You need to import trusted root certificates in order to restore NuGet packages. You can do that with the `mozroots` tool.

	mozroots --import --sync

Installing DNVM
===============

You need DNVM to acquire a (or multiple) .NET Execution Environment (DNX) SDKs. DNVM is simply a script, which doesn't depend on .NET.

	curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Home/dev/dnvminstall.sh | DNX_BRANCH=dev sh && source ~/.dnx/dnvm/dnvm.sh

You can see the currently installed DNX versions with `dnvm list`, which will display an empty set of installed runtimes.

	dnvm list

Installing the .NET Core DNX SDK
================================

You first need to acquire the Mono DNX. It doesn't include Mono, but is needed to use the DNX tools on top of Mono. In particular, the DNU command is not yet supported on .NET Core, requiring us to use Mono for this purpose (until DNU runs on .NET Core). Mono is the default DNX, do you can acquire it via `dnvm upgrade`.

	dnvm upgrade -u

Next, acquire the .NET Core DNX SDK.

	dnvm install latest -r coreclr -u

You can see the currently installed DNX versions with `dnvm list`.

	dnvm list

```
Active Version              Runtime Arch Location             Alias
------ -------              ------- ---- --------             -----
  *    1.0.0-beta5-11649    coreclr x64  ~/.dnx/runtimes
       1.0.0-beta5-11649    mono         ~/.dnx/runtimes      default
```

Write your App
==============

You need a Hello World application to run. You can write your own, if you'd like. Here's a very simple one:

```csharp
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, Linux");
        Console.WriteLine("Love from CoreCLR.");
    }
}
```

Some people on the .NET Core team are partial to a demo console app on corefxlab repo which will print a picture for you. Download the [corefxlab demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/corefxlab/master/demos/CoreClrConsoleApplications/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cs) to the demo directory.

You need a `project.json` that matches your app. Use this one. It will work for both of the apps provided/referenced above. Save the project.json beside your app.

```
{
    "version": "1.0.0-*",
    "dependencies": {
    },
    "frameworks" : {
        "dnx451" : { },
        "dnxcore50" : {
            "dependencies": {
                "System.Console": "4.0.0-beta-*"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run your App
============

You need to restore packages for your app, based on your project.json, with `dnu restore`. You will need to run this command under the Mono DNX. Make sure that you are using that one.

	dnvm use 1.0.0-beta5-11649 -r mono
	dnu restore

You can run your app with .NET Core, although make sure to switch to that DNX.

    dnvm use 1.0.0-beta5-11649 -r coreclr
	dnx . run

	Hello, Linux
	Love from CoreCLR.
