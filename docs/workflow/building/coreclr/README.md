# Building

To build just CoreCLR, use the `--subsetCategory` flag to the `build.sh` (or `build.cmd`) script at the repo root:

For Linux:
```
./build.sh --subsetCategory coreclr
```

For Windows:
```
build.cmd --subsetCategory coreclr
```

By default, build generates a 'debug' build type, that includes asserts and is easier for some people to debug. If you want to make performance measurements, or just want tests to execute more quickly, you can also build the 'release' version (which does not have these checks) by adding the flag `-configuration release` (or `-c release`), for example:
```
./build.sh --subsetCategory coreclr -configuration release
```

CoreCLR also supports a 'checked' build type which has asserts enabled like 'debug', but is built with the native compiler optimizer enabled, so it runs much faster. This is the usual mode used for running tests in the CI system. You can build that using, for example:
```
./build.sh --subsetCategory coreclr -configuration checked
```

This will produce outputs as follows:

- Product binaries will be dropped in `artifacts\bin\coreclr\<OS>.<arch>.<flavor>` folder.
- A NuGet package, Microsoft.Dotnet.CoreCLR, will be created under `artifacts\bin\coreclr\<OS>.<arch>.<flavor>\.nuget` folder.
- Test binaries will be dropped under `artifacts\tests\coreclr\<OS>.<arch>.<flavor>` folder. However, the root build script will not build the tests.

The build places logs in `artifacts\log` and these are useful when the build fails.

The build places all of its intermediate output in the `artifacts\obj\coreclr` directory, so if you remove that directory you can force a
full rebuild.

To build CoreCLR, the root build script invokes the `src\coreclr\build.cmd` (or build.sh) script. To build the CoreCLR tests, you must use this script.
Use `build -?` to learn about the options to this script.

See [Running Tests](../../testing/coreclr/testing.md) for instructions on running the tests.
