# Building Mono

To build the Mono runtime, you must first do a complete runtime build (coreclr, libraries, and then mono).  At the repo root, simply execute:

```bash
./build.sh 
```
or on Windows,
```bat
build.cmd
```
Note that the debug configuration is the default option. It generates a 'debug' output and that includes asserts, fewer code optimizations, and is easier for debugging. If you want to make performance measurements, or just want tests to execute more quickly, you can also build the 'release' version which does not have these checks by adding the flag `-configuration release` (or `-c release`).
 

Once you've built the whole runtime and assuming you want to work with just mono, you want to use the following command:

```bash
./build.sh --subset mono
```
or on Windows,
```bat
build.cmd -subset mono
```
When the build completes, product binaries will be dropped in the `artifacts\bin\mono\<OS>.<arch>.<flavor>` folder.

### Useful Build Arguments
Here are a list of build arguments that may be of use:

`/p:MonoEnableLlvm=true` - Builds mono w/ LLVM

`/p:MonoEnableLlvm=true /p:MonoLLVMDir=path/to/llvm` - Builds mono w/ LLVM from a custom path

`/p:MonoEnableLlvm=true /p:MonoLLVMDir=path/to/llvm /p:MonoLLVMUseCxx11Abi=true` - Builds mono w/ LLVM 
from a custom path (and that LLVM was built with C++11 ABI)

For `build.sh`

`/p:DisableCrossgen=true` - Skips building the installer if you don't need it (builds faster)

The build has a number of options that you can learn about using build -?.

## Packages

To generate nuget packages:

```bash
./build.sh --subset mono -pack (with optional release configuration)
```
or on Windows,
```bat
build.cmd -subset mono -pack (with optional release configuration)
```

The following packages will be created under `artifacts\packages\<configuration>\Shipping`:

- `Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.Mono.<version>-dev.<number>.1.nupkg`
- `runtime.<OS>.Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.Mono.<version>-dev.<number>.1.nupkg`
- `transport.Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.Mono.<version>-dev.<number>.1.nupkg`
- `transport.runtime.<OS>.Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.Mono.<version>-dev.<number>.1.nupkg`

## Important Notes 

Test binaries are not yet available for mono.

The build places logs in `artifacts\log` and these are useful when the build fails.

The build places all of its output in the `artifacts\obj\mono` directory, so if you remove that directory you can force a
full rebuild.
