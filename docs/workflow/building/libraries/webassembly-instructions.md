# Build for WebAssembly

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already done so, please read [this document](../../README.md#Build_Requirements) to understand the build requirements for your operating system.

The Emscripten SDK (emsdk) needs to be installed.  Follow the installation guide [here](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#sdk-download-and-install) or run `make -C src/mono/wasm provision-wasm` to install emsdk into `src/mono/wasm/emsdk`.

Once installed the `EMSDK_PATH` environment variable needs to be set:

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
export EMSDK_PATH=<FULL_PATH_TO_SDK_INSTALL>/emsdk
```

## Building everything

At this time no other build dependencies are necessary to start building for WebAssembly.

This document explains how to work on the runtime or libraries. If you haven't already done so, please read [this document](../../README.md#Configurations) to understand configurations.

For Linux and macOS:

```bash
./build.sh -os Browser -configuration Release
```

Artifacts will be placed in `artifacts/bin/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.browser-wasm/Release/`. When rebuilding with `build.sh` after a code change, you need to ensure that the `mono.wasmruntime` and `libs.pretest` subsets are included even for a Mono-only change or this directory will not be updated (details below).

## Building Mono's System.Private.CoreLib or runtime

If you are working on core parts of Mono you will probably need to build the Mono runtime and [System.Private.CoreLib](../../../design/coreclr/botr/corelib.md) which can be built with the following:

```bash
./build.sh mono -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

To build just System.Private.CoreLib without the Mono runtime you can use the `Mono.CoreLib` subset:

```bash
./build.sh mono.corelib -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

To build just the Mono runtime without System.Private.CoreLib use the `Mono.Runtime` subset:

```bash
./build.sh mono.runtime -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

Building both Mono/System.Private.CoreLib and the managed libraries:

```bash
./build.sh mono+libs -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

## Building the WebAssembly runtime files

The WebAssembly implementation files are built after the libraries source build and made available in the artifacts folder.  If you are working on the code base and need to compile just these modules then building the `Mono.WasmRuntime` subset will allow one to do that:

```bash
./build.sh mono.wasmruntime -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

## Updating in-tree runtime pack

If you don't run the full `Libs` subset then you can use the `Libs.PreTest` subset to copy updated runtime/corelib binaries to the runtime pack which is used for running tests:

```bash
./build.sh libs.pretest -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

## Building libraries native components only

The libraries build contains some native code. This includes shims over libc, openssl, gssapi, and zlib. The build system uses CMake to generate Makefiles using clang. The build also uses git for generating some version information.

```bash
./build.sh libs.native -os Browser -c Debug|Release
```

## Building individual libraries

Individual projects and libraries can be build by specifying the build configuration.

**Examples**

- Build all projects for a given library (e.g.: System.Net.Http) including the tests

```bash
./build.sh -os Browser -c Release --projects <full-repository-path>/src/libraries/System.Net.Http/System.Net.Http.sln
```

- Build only the source project of a given library (e.g.: System.Net.Http)

```bash
 ./build.sh -os Browser -c Release --projects <full-repository-path>/src/libraries/System.Net.Http/src/System.Net.Http.csproj
```

More information and examples can be found in the [libraries](./README.md#building-individual-libraries) document.

## Notes

A `Debug` build sets the following environment variables by default:

- debugging and logging which will log garbage collection information to the console.

```
MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug
MONO_LOG_MASK=gc
```

  #### Example:
```
L: GC_MAJOR_SWEEP: major size: 752K in use: 39K
L: GC_MAJOR: (user request) time 3.00ms, stw 3.00ms los size: 0K in use: 0K
```

- Redirects the `System.Diagnostics.Debug` output to `stderr` which will show up on the console.

```
    // Setting this env var allows Diagnostic.Debug to write to stderr.  In a browser environment this
    // output will be sent to the console.  Right now this is the only way to emit debug logging from
    // corlib assemblies.
    monoeg_g_setenv ("COMPlus_DebugWriteToStdErr", "1", 0);
```

## Updating Emscripten version in Docker image

First update emscripten version in the [webassembly Dockerfile](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker/blob/master/src/ubuntu/18.04/webassembly/Dockerfile#L19).

```
ENV EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION=1.39.16
```

Submit a PR request with the updated version, wait for all checks to pass and for the request to be merged. A [master.json file](https://github.com/dotnet/versions/blob/master/build-info/docker/image-info.dotnet-dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker-master.json#L1126) will be updated with the a new docker image.

```

    }
  ]
},
```

Copy the docker image tag and replace it in [platform-matrix.yml](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/eng/pipelines/common/platform-matrix.yml#L172)

```
container:
    image: ubuntu-18.04-webassembly-20200409132031-f70ea41
    registry: mcr
```

Open a PR request with the new image.
