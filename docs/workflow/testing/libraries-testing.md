# Testing Libraries

We use the OSS testing framework [xunit](http://xunit.github.io/).

To build the tests and run them you can call the libraries build script.

**Examples**
- The following shows how to build only the tests but not run them
```
libraries -buildtests
```

- The following builds and runs all tests for netcoreapp in release configuration.
```
libraries -buildtests -test -c Release -f netcoreapp
```

- The following example shows how to pass extra msbuild properties to ignore tests ignored in CI.
```
libraries -test /p:WithoutCategories=IgnoreForCI
```

## Running tests on the command line

To build tests you need to pass the `-buildtests` flag to build.cmd/sh or if you want to build both src and tests you pass `-buildtests` flag (`libraries -restore -build -buildtests`). Note that you need to specify -restore and -build additionally as those are only implicit if no action is passed in.

If you are interested in building and running the tests only for a specific library, then there are two different ways to do it:

The easiest (and recommended) way to do it, is by simply building the test .csproj file for that library.

```cmd
cd src\libraries\System.Collections.Immutable\tests
dotnet msbuild /t:BuildAndTest   ::or /t:Test to just run the tests if the binaries are already built
dotnet msbuild /t:RebuildAndTest ::this will cause a test project to rebuild and then run tests
```

It is possible to pass parameters to the underlying xunit runner via the `XUnitOptions` parameter, e.g.:
```cmd
dotnet msbuild /t:Test "/p:XUnitOptions=-class Test.ClassUnderTests"
```

There may be multiple projects in some directories so you may need to specify the path to a specific test project to get it to build and run the tests.

#### Running a single test on the command line

To quickly run or debug a single test from the command line, set the XunitMethodName property, e.g.:
```cmd
dotnet msbuild /t:RebuildAndTest /p:XunitMethodName={FullyQualifiedNamespace}.{ClassName}.{MethodName}
```

#### Running tests in a different target framework

Each test project can potentially have multiple build configurations. There are some tests that might be OS-specific, or might be testing an API that is available only on some target frameworks, so the `BuildConfigurations` property specifies the valid configurations. By default we will build and run only the default build configuration which is `netcoreapp`. The rest of the configurations will need to be built and ran by specifying the configuration options.

```cmd
cd src\libraries\System.Runtime\tests
dotnet msbuild System.Runtime.Tests.csproj /p:TargetGroup=netfx
```
