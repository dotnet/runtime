# Testing Libraries

We use the OSS testing framework [xunit](http://xunit.github.io/).

To build the tests and run them you can call the libraries build script.

**Examples**
- The following shows how to build only the tests but not run them:
```
build.cmd/sh -subset libs.tests
```

- The following builds and runs all tests in release configuration:
```
build.cmd/sh -subset libs -test -c Release
```

- The following example shows how to pass extra msbuild properties to ignore tests ignored in CI:
```
build.cmd/sh -subset libs -test /p:WithoutCategories=IgnoreForCI
```

Unless you specifiy `-testnobuild`, test assemblies are implicitly built when invoking the `Test` action.
- The following shows how to only test the libraries without building them
```
build.cmd/sh -subset libs -test -testnobuild
```

## Running tests on the command line

To build tests you need to specify the `test` subset when invoking build.cmd/sh: `build.cmd/sh -subset libs.tests`.

The easiest (and recommended) way to build and run the tests for a specific library, is to invoke the `Test` target on that library:
```cmd
cd src\libraries\System.Collections.Immutable\tests
dotnet build /t:Test
```

It is possible to pass parameters to the underlying xunit runner via the `XUnitOptions` parameter, e.g.:
```cmd
dotnet build /t:Test "/p:XUnitOptions=-class Test.ClassUnderTests"
```

There may be multiple projects in some directories so you may need to specify the path to a specific test project to get it to build and run the tests.

#### Running a single test on the command line

To quickly run or debug a single test from the command line, set the XunitMethodName property, e.g.:
```cmd
dotnet build /t:Test /p:XunitMethodName={FullyQualifiedNamespace}.{ClassName}.{MethodName}
```

#### Running outer loop tests

To run all tests, including "outer loop" tests (which are typically slower and in some test suites less reliable, but which are more comprehensive):
```cmd
dotnet build /t:Test /p:Outerloop=true
```

#### Running tests on a different target framework

Each test project can potentially have multiple target frameworks. There are some tests that might be OS-specific, or might be testing an API that is available only on some target frameworks, so the `TargetFrameworks` property specifies the valid target frameworks. By default we will build and run only the default build target framework which is `netcoreapp5.0`. The rest of the `TargetFrameworks` will need to be built and ran by specifying the `BuildTargetFramework` option, e.g.:
```cmd
dotnet build src\libraries\System.Runtime\tests\System.Runtime.Tests.csproj /p:BuildTargetFramework=net472
```

## Running tests from Visual Studio

**Test Explorer** will be able to discover the tests only if the solution is opened with `build -vs` command, e.g.:
```cmd
build -vs System.Net.Http
```
If running the tests from **Test Explorer** does nothing, it probably tries to use x86 dotnet installation instead of the x64 one. It can be fixed by setting the x64 architecture manually in the test settings.

It is also possible to execute the tests by simply debugging the test project once it's been built. It will underneath call the same command as `dotnet build /t:Test` does.
