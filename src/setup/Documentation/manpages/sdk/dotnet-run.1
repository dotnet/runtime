.SH NAME
.PP
dotnet\-run \-\- Runs source code \[aq]in\-place\[aq] without any
explicit compile or launch commands.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]dotnet\ run\ [\-\-verbose]\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The run command provides a convenient option to run source code with one
command.
It compiles source code, generates an output program and then runs that
program.
This command is useful for fast iterative development and can also be
used to run a source\-distributed program (e.g.
website).
.PP
This command relies on \f[C]dotnet\-compile(1)\f[] to compile source
inputs to a .NET assembly, before launching the program.
The requirements for and handling of source inputs for this command are
all inherited from the compile command.
The documentation for the compile command provides more information on
those requirements.
.PP
Output files, are written to the child \f[C]bin\f[] folder, which will
be created if it doesn\[aq]t exist.
Files will be overwritten as needed.
Temporary files are written to the child \f[C]obj\f[] folder.
