CLRTest.Jit.targets

WARNING:  DO NOT MODIFY this file unless you are knowledgeable about MSBuild and have
          created a backup copy.  Incorrect changes to this file will make it
          impossible to load or build your projects from the command-line or the IDE.

This file contains the logic for generating command scripts for special GC tests.

WARNING:   When setting properties based on their current state (for example:
           <Foo Condition="'$(Foo)'==''>Bar</Foo>).  Be very careful.  Another script generation
           target might be trying to do the same thing.  It's better to avoid this by instead setting a new property.
           
           Additionally, be careful with itemgroups.  Include will propagate outside of the target too!
