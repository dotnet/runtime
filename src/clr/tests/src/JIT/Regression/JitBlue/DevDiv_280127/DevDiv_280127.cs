// The original repro for this test was an assertion after code generation that the actual maximum depth of the stack
// was less than or identical to the estimated depth of the stack as calculated during morph. The calculation was
// incorrect when a math intrinsic was used as an argument to a function with on-stack parameters (e.g. the call to
// `M` on line 18).
