 * The basic scenario is the test should have two returns (endfinallys) in the finally block.
 * We cannot put a return statement in the finally block for C#
 * In ordinary circumstances, like this, the C# compiler generates one finally with a branch to that finally for the first break statement.
 * Hence the IL manually inserts another endfinally within to reproduce this bug.
 * When optimizing away the if(dummy != 0) block, since it contains a return, the JIT looks at the finally block when removing this basic block.
 * The x86 JIT expected exactly one return from the finally block, and this test breaks that assumption.
 *
 * From notes from the dev:
 * When we are trying to delete a sequence of block because they have become unreachable due to an optimization we can hit this assert when we attempt to delete the BBJ_CALL/BBJ_ALWAYS blocks
 * A BBJ_CALL block is a call to a finally region the assert is expecting that the will be exactly one BBJ_RET branch back from the finally block to the BBJ_ALWAYS block.  Typically this is true, however for finally blocks that use multiple return statements (generally a poor practice IMHO)  we can have more than one BBJ_RET back to the BBJ_ALWAYS block.  Thus hitting the assert.  For a retail build we would not assert and would instead just remove one of the back edges to the BBJ_ALWAYS block, which is wrong but does actually cause any further problems in a retail build.
 * The fix is to loop over all of the back edged into the BBJ_ALWAYS block and remove all of them.
