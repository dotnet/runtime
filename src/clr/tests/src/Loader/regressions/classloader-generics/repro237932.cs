// This is regression test for VSWhidbey 237932
// The issue here was that the ThreadStatic field was previously shared for all C1<objref> types
// and so when we created C1<System.OverflowException> and C1<System.InvalidCastException> the ThreadStatic
// field got incremented to 2, which is wrong.
