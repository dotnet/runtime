** Source:  pal_finally.c (test 3)
**
** Purpose: Tests the PAL implementation of the PAL_FINALLY in the
**          presence of a call stack. An exception is forced and
**          passed to two nested exception filters for consideration.
**          The first filter returns EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH so the
**          second can run and return EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER.  The
**          initial exception handler should be skipped, and the
**          second executed, and all the PAL_FINALLY blocks handled
**
