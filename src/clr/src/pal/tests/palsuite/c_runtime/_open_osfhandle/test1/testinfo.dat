Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the _open_osfhandle function.
= This API accepts a OS Handle returned from CreatePipe() and
= a flag of _O_RDONLY and returns a C Run-Time handle. The test
= will write to the pipe and pass the C Run-Time handle to _fdopen
= to open the Read Handle to compare what was written with what
= was wrote. They should be the same.
