** Source:  test1.c
**
** Purpose: Create an environment variable and then use getenv to get
** a pointer to it.  Check that the pointer is valid and that the string
** is what we expected.  Also check that searching for a non-existent 
** variable will cause getenv to return NULL. Also check that function
** passes when the parameter has it's casing changed (e.g upper case)
