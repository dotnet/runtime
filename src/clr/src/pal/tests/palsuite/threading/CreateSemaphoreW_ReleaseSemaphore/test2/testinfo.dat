Function = CreateSemaphoreW / ReleaseSemaphore
Name = Positive Test for CreateSemaphoreW and ReleaseSemaphore
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = createsemaphore
Description 
= Implementation of Producer / Consumer IPC problem using CreateSemaphoreW
= and ReleaseSemaphore functions.  This test case exercises CreateSemaphoreW
= , ReleaseSemaphore, CreateThread and WaitForSingleObject functions.  
= Since there is no way to currently create "pseudo" random events in the 
= pal, this example does not behave as classic bounded buffers would.  This
= test case is designed to starve the producer and have the consumer fill
= the buffer.
