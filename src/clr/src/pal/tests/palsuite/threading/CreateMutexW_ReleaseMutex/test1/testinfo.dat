Function = CreateMutexW / ReleaseMutex
Name = Positive Test for CreateMutexW and ReleaseMutex 
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = createmutexw
Description 
= This test cases test whether a Mutex object created
= with CreateMutexW really works by mutually excluding
= threads from accessing a data structure at the same
= time.  Here we have a buffer that can be filled or
= emptied, we use a Mutex object to ensure that one
= operation cannot be started until the other is
= finished.  If one operation detects that the other
= has not finished, it fails.  There is a Producer
= thread which will try to fill the buffer 25 times,
= and a consumer thread which try to empty the buffer
= 25 times.  If either the fill or empty operations
= fails because the Mutex failed to mutually exclude
= then, the corresponding thread will set an error
= flag and return.  This will cause the test case to
= fail.
= To increase the probability of identifying problems,
= the Fill opeartion has been slowed dowm with a call
= to Sleep.  This ensures that one operation will try
= to access the shared buffer while the other is in
= progress.
= NOTE: this test case also serves as a test case for
= WaitForSingleObject.
