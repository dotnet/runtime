** Source: test1.c
**
** Purpose: Test for SetEnvironmentVariableA() function. Set an
** environment variable and check to ensure success was returned.  Then
** get the environment variable and compare to the correct value.  Also, check
** that calling the function again, resets the variable properly.  And that
** calling with NULL deletes the variable.
**
** Depends:
**     GetEnvironmentVariable
**     memcmp
**     memset
**     strlen
