Function = GetLongPathNameW
Name = Test for GetLongPathNameW Win32 (test 1)
Type = DEFAULT 
EXE1 = getlongpathnamew
Description
= Tests invalid path names. Tests conversion of short to long
= path names as well as passing it a path name that is already short.
= Under BSD, there isn't a shortened version of directory names so
= I just use a long path name as the short path name to ensure it returns
= the same thing.
