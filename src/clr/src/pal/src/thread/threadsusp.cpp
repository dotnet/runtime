Function:
  InternalSuspendThreadFromData

InternalSuspendThreadFromData suspends the target thread. It first checks if 
the target thread is suspending itself. Next, it acquires the thread(s) 
suspension locks before attempting the actual suspension. Once the attempt
is completed, the locks are released. The starting suspend count of the 
target thread is passed back to the caller of this function.

Note that ReleaseSuspensionLock(s) is called before hitting ASSERTs in error
paths. Currently, this seems unnecessary since asserting within 
InternalSuspendThreadFromData will not cause cleanup to occur. However,
this may change since it would be preferable to perform cleanup in these
situations. Thus, calls to release suspension locks remain in the error paths.

Function:
  AcquireSuspensionLocks

AcquireSuspensionLocks is used to acquire the suspension locks
of a suspender (or resumer) and target thread. The thread will 
perform a blocking call to acquire its own suspension lock
and will then try to acquire the target thread's lock without blocking. 
If it fails to acquire the target's lock, it releases its own lock 
and the thread will try to acquire both locks again. The key 
is that both locks must be acquired together.

Originally, only blocking calls were used to acquire the suspender
and the target lock. However, this was problematic since a thread
could acquire its own lock and then block on acquiring the target
lock. In the meantime, the target could have already acquired its
own lock and be attempting to suspend the suspender thread. This 
clearly causes deadlock. A second approach used locking hierarchies,
where locks were acquired use thread id ordering. This was better but
suffered from the scenario where thread A acquires thread B's
suspension mutex first. In the meantime, thread C acquires thread A's
suspension mutex and its own. Thus, thread A is suspended while
holding thread B's mutex. This is problematic if thread C now wants
to suspend thread B. The issue here is that a thread can be
suspended while holding someone else's mutex but not holding its own.
In the end, the correct approach is to always acquire your suspension 
mutex first. This prevents you from being suspended while holding the 
target's mutex. Then, attempt to acquire the target's mutex. If the mutex 
cannot be acquired, release your own and try again. This all or nothing 
approach is the safest and avoids nasty race conditions.

If USE_GLOBAL_LOCK_FOR_SUSPENSION is defined, the calling thread 
will acquire the global lock when possible.

    /* The do-while loop is necessary for self suspension situations. 
    After a self suspending thread (thread A) releases its mutex, 
    there is a small window between it's handle being returned from CreateThread 
    (making it possible for other threads to perform suspension and resumption 
    operations on it) and the thread actually being suspended. 
    During the window, another thread (thread B) may call ResumeThread on A. 
    Because A's suspension count was already incremented, thread B believes 
    it was already suspended so it decrements the count and calls the native 
    continue function. Since A hadn't called the native suspend function yet, 
    the native resume function does nothing but B thinks A was resumed. 

    The workaround is to use a do while loop that checks the target thread's 
    self suspension field. The target sets its field to zero once it's resumed 
    after self suspending. The resuming thread calls continue in the loop 
    until the field is set to zero. Calling continue repeatedly is safe since 
    calling continue on an executing thread has no effect. Also, since the 
    resuming thread holds the target's suspension mutex, no other threads can 
    attempt to suspend or resume the target until the resume operation is complete. */

            target's semaphore while waiting for it to set its selfSusp flag to
            FALSE. However, we'd prefer to enforce the behavior of the
