; Unicode byte order mark (U+FEFF) written in UTF-8 at the start of this file.

; For resource info, see the ResourceManager documentation and the ResGen tool,

; ResGen now supports limited preprocessing of txt files, you can use

; The naming scheme is: [Namespace.] ExceptionName _ Reason
; We'll suppress "System." where possible.
; Examples:
; Argument_Null
; Reflection.TargetInvokation_someReason

; Usage Notes:
; * Keep exceptions in alphabetical order by package
; * A single space may exist on either side of the equal sign.
; * Follow the naming conventions.
; * Any lines starting with a '#' or ';' are ignored
; * Equal signs aren't legal characters for keys, but may occur in values.
; * Correctly punctuate all sentences. Most resources should end in a period.
;       Remember, your mother will probably read some of these messages.
; * You may use " (quote), \n and \t. Use \\ for a single '\' character.
; * String inserts work.  i.e., BadNumber_File = Wrong number in file "{0}".
