** Purpose: Serves as a hint to ngen that the decorated method
** (and its statically determinable call graph) should be
** prepared (as for Constrained Execution Region use). This
** is primarily useful in the scenario where the method in
** question will be prepared explicitly at runtime and the
** author of the method knows this and wishes to avoid the
** overhead of runtime preparation.
