// Provides a mechanism to store an array of DWORD-typed fields in a space-efficient manner. There are some
// caveats:
//  1) Fields can be written and read in an uncompressed form (a simple array of DWORD values) until the
//     PackFields() method is invoked. Once this method has been invoked (and returned true) fields have been
//     compacted and must not be modified again. That is, the primary usage of this class is to store a set of
//     initialized-once fields.
//  2) The compaction algorithm relies on the fields containing small values (such as counts). Avoid storing
//     fields that have special sentinel values (such as all bits set) which will frequently set high order
//     bits.
//  3) An instance of PackedDWORDFields will take up a fixed quantity of memory equivalent to an array of
//     DWORD fields. If PackFields() returns true then the fields values frozen at the time of the call have
//     been compressed into a fewer number of bytes in-place. This smaller size will always be a multiple of
//     sizeof(DWORD) in length and is reported by GetPackedSize(). If a PackedDWORDFields structure is being
//     declared as a field inside another structure it is typically wise to place the field last to take
//     advantage of this size reduction (e.g. when saving the outer structure into an ngen image). If
//     PackFields() returns false then the fields remain unpacked and unchanged.
//  4) The caller retains the responsibility of recording whether an instance of PackedDWORDFields is in the
//     packed or unpacked state. This is important since incorrect behavior will result if the wrong methods
//     are used for the current state (e.g. calling GetUnpackedField() on a packed instance). This is not done
//     automatically since there are no bits free to store the state. However, under a debug build correct
//     usage will be checked (at the expensive of extra storage space).
//  5) The space saving made come at a runtime CPU cost to access the fields. Do not use this mechanism to
//     compact fields that must be read on a perfomance critical path. If unsure, measure the performance of
//     this solution before committing to it.
