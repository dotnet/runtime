// VirtualCallStubManager is the heart of the stub dispatch logic. See the book of the runtime entry
// 
// file:../../doc/BookOfTheRuntime/ClassLoader/VirtualStubDispatchDesign.doc
// 
// The basic idea is that a call to an interface (it could also be used for virtual calls in general, but we
// do not do this), is simply the code
// 
//     call [DispatchCell]
// 
// Where we make sure 'DispatchCell' points at stubs that will do the right thing. DispatchCell is writable
// so we can udpate the code over time. There are three basic types of stubs that the dispatch cell can point
// to.
//     * Lookup: The intial stub that has no 'fast path' and simply pushes a ID for interface being called
//         and calls into the runtime at code:VirtualCallStubManager.ResolveWorkerStatic.
//     * Dispatch: Lookup stubs are patched to this stub which has a fast path that checks for a particular
//         Method Table and if that fails jumps to code that
//         * Decrements a 'missCount' (starts out as code:STUB_MISS_COUNT_VALUE). If this count goes to zero
//             code:VirtualCallStubManager.BackPatchWorkerStatic is called, morphs it into a resolve stub
//             (however since this decrementing logic is SHARED among all dispatch stubs, it may take
//             multiples of code:STUB_MISS_COUNT_VALUE if mulitple call sites are actively polymorphic (this
//             seems unlikley).
//         * Calls a resolve stub (Whenever a dispatch stub is created, it always has a cooresponding resolve
//             stub (but the resolve stubs are shared among many dispatch stubs).
//     * Resolve: see code:ResolveStub. This looks up the Method table in a process wide cache (see
//         code:ResolveCacheElem, and if found, jumps to it. This code path is about 17 instructions long (so
//         pretty fast, but certainly much slower than a normal call). If the method table is not found in
//         the cache, it calls into the runtime code:VirtualCallStubManager.ResolveWorkerStatic, which
//         populates it.
// So the general progression is call site's cells
//     * start out life pointing to a lookup stub
//     * On first call they get updated into a dispatch stub. When this misses, it calls a resolve stub,
//         which populates a resovle stub's cache, but does not update the call site' cell (thus it is still
//         pointing at the dispatch cell.
//     * After code:STUB_MISS_COUNT_VALUE misses, we update the call site's cell to point directly at the
//         resolve stub (thus avoiding the overhead of the quick check that always seems to be failing and
//         the miss count update).
//         
// QUESTION: What is the lifetimes of the various stubs and hash table entries?
// 
// QUESTION: There does not seem to be any logic that will change a call site's cell once it becomes a
// Resolve stub. Thus once a particular call site becomes a Resolve stub we live with the Resolve stub's
// (in)efficiency forever.

#StubDispatchNotes

A note on approach.  The cache and hash tables used by the stub and lookup mechanism
are designed with an eye to minimizing interlocking and/or syncing and/or locking operations.
They are intended to run in a highly concurrent environment.  Since there is no magic,
some tradeoffs and and some implementation constraints are required.  The basic notion
is that if all reads and writes are atomic and if all functions and operations operate
correctly in the face of commutative reorderings of the visibility of all reads and writes
across threads, then we don't have to interlock, sync, or serialize.  Our approximation of
this is:

1. All reads and all writes to tables must be atomic.  This effectively limits the actual entry
size in a table to be a pointer or a pointer sized thing.

2. All functions, like comparisons for equality or computation of hash values must function
correctly in the face of concurrent updating of the underlying table.  This is accomplished
by making the underlying structures/entries effectively immutable, if concurrency is in anyway possible.
By effectively immutatable, we mean that the stub or token structure is either immutable or that
if it is ever written, all possibley concurrent writes are attempting to write the same value (atomically)
or that the competing (atomic) values do not affect correctness, and that the function operates correctly whether
or not any of the writes have taken place (is visible yet).  The constraint we maintain is that all competeing
updates (and their visibility or lack thereof) do not alter the correctness of the program.

3. All tables are inexact.  The counts they hold (e.g. number of contained entries) may be inaccurrate,
but that inaccurracy cannot affect their correctness.  Table modifications, such as insertion of
an new entry may not succeed, but such failures cannot affect correctness.  This implies that just
because a stub/entry is not present in a table, e.g. has been removed, that does not mean that
it is not in use.  It also implies that internal table structures, such as discarded hash table buckets,
cannot be freely recycled since another concurrent thread may still be walking thru it.

4. Occassionaly it is necessary to pick up the pieces that have been dropped on the floor
so to speak, e.g. actually recycle hash buckets that aren't in use.  Since we have a natural
sync point already in the GC, we use that to provide cleanup points.  We need to make sure that code that
is walking our structures is not a GC safe point.  Hence if the GC calls back into us inside the GC
sync point, we know that nobody is inside our stuctures and we can safely rearrange and recycle things.

Entry is an abstract class.  We will make specific subclasses for each kind of
entry.  Entries hold references to stubs or tokens.  The principle thing they provide
is a virtual Equals function that is used by the caching and hashing tables within which
the stubs and tokens are stored.  Entries are typically stack allocated by the routines
that call into the hash and caching functions, and the functions stuff stubs into the entry
to do the comparisons.  Essentially specific entry subclasses supply a vtable to a stub
as and when needed.  This means we don't have to have vtables attached to stubs.

Summarizing so far, there is a struct for each kind of stub or token of the form XXXXStub.
They provide that actual storage layouts.
There is a stuct in which each stub which has code is containted of the form XXXXHolder.
They provide alignment and anciliary storage for the stub code.
There is a subclass of Entry for each kind of stub or token, of the form XXXXEntry.
They provide the specific implementations of the virtual functions declared in Entry. */

/**************************************************************************************************
The hash tables are accessed via instances of the Prober.  Prober is a probe into a bucket
of the hash table, and therefore has an index which is the current probe position.
It includes a count of the number of probes done in that bucket so far and a stride
to step thru the bucket with.  To do comparisons, it has a reference to an entry with which
it can do comparisons (Equals(...)) of the entries (stubs) inside the hash table.  It also has
the key pair (keyA, keyB) that it is looking for.

Typically, an entry of the appropriate type is created on the stack and then the prober is created passing
in a reference to the entry.  The prober is used for a  complete operation, such as look for and find an
entry (stub), creating and inserting it as necessary.

The initial index and the stride are orthogonal hashes of the key pair, i.e. we are doing a varient of
double hashing.  When we initialize the prober (see FormHash below) we set the initial probe based on
one hash.  The stride (used as a modulo addition of the probe position) is based on a different hash and
is such that it will vist every location in the bucket before repeating.  Hence it is imperative that
the bucket size and the stride be relative prime wrt each other.  We have chosen to make bucket sizes
a power of 2, so we force stride to be odd.

Note -- it must be assumed that multiple probers are walking the same tables and buckets at the same time.
Additionally, the counts may not be accurate, and there may be duplicates in the tables.  Since the tables
do not allow concurrrent deletion, some of the concurrency issues are ameliorated.

/******************************************************************************************************
BucketTable is a bucketized hash table.  It uses FastTables for its buckets.  The hash tables
used by the VirtualCallStubManager are BucketTables.  The number of buckets is fixed at the time
the table is created.  The actual buckets are allocated as needed, and grow as necessary.  The reason
for using buckets is primarily to reduce the cost of growing, since only a single bucket is actually
grown at any given time.  Since the hash tables are accessed infrequently, the load factor that
controls growth is quite high (90%).  Since we use hashing to pick the bucket, and we use hashing to
lookup inside the bucket, it is important that the hashing function used here is orthogonal to the ones
used in the buckets themselves (see FastTable::FormHash).
