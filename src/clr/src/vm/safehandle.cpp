    // To prevent handle recycling security attacks we must enforce the
    // following invariant: we cannot successfully AddRef a handle on which
    // we've committed to the process of releasing.

    // We ensure this by never AddRef'ing a handle that is marked closed and
    // never marking a handle as closed while the ref count is non-zero. For
    // this to be thread safe we must perform inspection/updates of the two
    // values as a single atomic operation. We achieve this by storing them both
    // in a single aligned DWORD and modifying the entire state via interlocked
    // compare exchange operations.

    // Additionally we have to deal with the problem of the Dispose operation.
    // We must assume that this operation is directly exposed to untrusted
    // callers and that malicious callers will try and use what is basically a
    // Release call to decrement the ref count to zero and free the handle while
    // it's still in use (the other way a handle recycling attack can be
    // mounted). We combat this by allowing only one Dispose to operate against
    // a given safe handle (which balances the creation operation given that
    // Dispose suppresses finalization). We record the fact that a Dispose has
    // been requested in the same state field as the ref count and closed state.

    // So the state field ends up looking like this:
    //
    //  31                                                        2  1   0
