// TieredCompilationManager determines which methods should be recompiled and
// how they should be recompiled to best optimize the running code. It then
// handles logistics of getting new code created and installed.
//
//
// # Current feature state
//
// This feature is incomplete and currently experimental. To enable it
// you need to set COMPLUS_EXPERIMENTAL_TieredCompilation = 1. When the environment
// variable is unset the runtime should work as normal, but when it is set there are 
// anticipated incompatibilities and limited cross cutting test coverage so far.
//   Profiler - Anticipated incompatible with ReJIT, untested in general
//   ETW - Anticipated incompatible with the ReJIT id of the MethodJitted rundown events
//   Managed debugging - Anticipated incompatible with breakpoints/stepping that are
//                       active when a method is recompiled.
//   
//
// Testing that has been done so far largely consists of regression testing with
// the environment variable off + functional/perf testing of the Music Store ASP.Net
// workload as a basic example that the feature can work. Running the coreclr repo
// tests with the env var on generates about a dozen failures in JIT tests. The issues
// are likely related to assertions about optimization behavior but haven't been
// properly investigated yet.
//
// If you decide to try this out on a new workload and run into trouble a quick note
// on github is appreciated but this code may have high churn for a while to come and
// there will be no sense investing a lot of time investigating only to have it rendered 
// moot by changes. I aim to keep this comment updated as things change.
//
//
// # Important entrypoints in this code:
//
// 
// a) .ctor and Init(...) - called once during AppDomain initialization
// b) OnMethodCalled(...) - called when a method is being invoked. When a method
//                     has been called enough times this is currently the only
//                     trigger that initiates re-compilation.
// c) OnAppDomainShutdown() - called during AppDomain::Exit() to begin the process
//                     of stopping tiered compilation. After this point no more
//                     background optimization work will be initiated but in-progress
//                     work still needs to complete.
//
// # Overall workflow
//
// Methods initially call into OnMethodCalled() and once the call count exceeds
// a fixed limit we queue work on to our internal list of methods needing to
// be recompiled (m_methodsToOptimize). If there is currently no thread
// servicing our queue asynchronously then we use the runtime threadpool
// QueueUserWorkItem to recruit one. During the callback for each threadpool work
// item we handle as many methods as possible in a fixed period of time, then
// queue another threadpool work item if m_methodsToOptimize hasn't been drained.
//
// The background thread enters at StaticOptimizeMethodsCallback(), enters the
// appdomain, and then begins calling OptimizeMethod on each method in the
// queue. For each method we jit it, then update the precode so that future
// entrypoint callers will run the new code.
// 
// # Error handling
//
// The overall principle is don't swallow terminal failures that may have corrupted the
// process (AV for example), but otherwise for any transient issue or functional limitation
// that prevents us from optimizing log it for diagnostics and then back out gracefully,
// continuing to run the less optimal code. The feature should be constructed so that
// errors are limited to OS resource exhaustion or poorly behaved managed code
// (for example within an AssemblyResolve event or static constructor triggered by the JIT).
