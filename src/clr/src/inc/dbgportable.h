//
// This header defines the template class Portable<T> which is designed to wrap primitive types in such a way
// that their physical representation is in a canonical format that can be safely transferred between hosts on
// different platforms.
//
// This is achieved by storing the wrapped datum in little-endian format (since most of our platforms are
// little-endian this makes the most sense from a performance perspective). On little-endian platforms the
// wrapper code will become a no-op and get optimized away by the compiler. On big-endian platforms
// assignments to a Portable<T> value will reverse the order of the bytes in the T value and reverse them back
// again on a read.
//
// Portable<T> is typically used to wrap the fields of structures sent directly over a network channel. In
// this fashion many of the values that would otherwise require manual endian-ness fixups are now marshalled
// and unmarshalled transparent right at the network transition.
//
// Care must be taken to identify any code that takes the address of a Portable<T>, since this is not
// generally safe (it could expose naive code to the network encoded form of the datum). In such situations
// the code is normally re-written to create a temporary instance of T on the stack, initialized to the
// correct host value by reading from the Portable<T> field. The address of this variable can now be taken
// safely (assuming its value is required only for some lexically scoped operation). Once the value is no
// longer being used, and if there is a possibility that the value may have been updated, the new value can be
// copied back into the Portable<T> field.
//
// Note that this header uses very basic data types only as it is included from both Win32/PAL code and native
// Mac code.
