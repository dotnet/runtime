// This tool exists to transform a high level description of Crst dependencies (i.e. which Crst type may be
// acquired before or after other Crst types) into a header file that defines a enum to describe each Crst
// type and tables that map type to numerical ranking and a string based name.
//
// To use the tool, run "csc.exe CrstTypeTool.cs" and run the resulting executable.
// 
// The Crst type definition file is written in a very simple language. Comments begin with '//' and continue
// to the end of the line. All remaining tokens after comment removal are simply sequences of non-whitespace
// characters separated by whitespace. Keywords are case-insensitive and identifiers (which are always Crst
// type names) are case sensitive. The language grammar is given below in EBNF-like form:
//
//      TopLevel        ::= CrstDefinition*
//
//      CrstDefinition  ::= 'Crst' <Crst type name> CrstDependency* 'End'
//
//      CrstDependency  ::= 'AcquiredBefore' <Crst type name>*
//                      |   'AcquiredAfter' <Crst type name>*
//                      |   'SameLevelAs' <Crst type name>*
//                      |   'Unordered'
//
// Crst type names match the CrstType enums used in the source code minus the 'Crst' prefix. For example
// CrstAppDomainCache is written as 'AppDomainCache' in the .def file.
//
// The dependency "A 'AcquiredBefore' B" indicates that CrstA may be legally held while CrstB is acquired.
// Similarly "A 'AcquiredAfter' B" indicates that CrstA may be legally acquired while CrstB is held. "A
// 'AcquiredBefore' B" is logically equivalent to "B 'AcquiredAfter' A" and authors may enter the dependency
// is whichever seems to make the most sense to them (or add both rules if they so desire).
//
// 'Unordered' indicates that the Crst type does not participate in ranking (there should be very few Crsts
// like this and those that are know how to avoid or deal with deadlocks manually).
//
// 'SameLevelAs' indicates the given Crst type may be acquired alongside any number of instances of the Crst
// types indicated. "A 'SameLevel' B" automatically implies "B 'SameLevel' A" so it's not necessary to specify
// the dependency both ways though authors can do so if they wish.
//
// Simple validation of the .def file (over and above syntax checking) is performed by this tool prior to
// emitting the header file. This will catch logic errors such as referencing a Crst type that is not
// defined or using the 'Unordered' attribute along with any other attribute within a single definition. It
// will also catch cycles in the dependency graph (i.e. definitions that logically describe a system where the
// Crst types can't be ranked).

// all the others). Identifying all the members is tricky because "A SameLevelAs B" and "B SameLevelAs C"
// implies "A SameLevelAs C". So we use a separate tracking structure, instances of the CrstTypeGroup type, to
// do the bookkeeping for us. Each Crst type belongs to either zero or one CrstTypeGroups. As we find new
// SameLevelAs relationships we create new groups, add types to existing groups or merge groups (as previous
// distinct groups are merged by the discovery of a SameLevelAs relationship that links them). By the time
// parsing has finished we are guaranteed to have discovered all the distinct, disjoint groups and to have
// fully populated them with the transitive closure of all related types. We can them normalize all groups
