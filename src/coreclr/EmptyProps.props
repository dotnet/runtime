<!-- This file is intentionally empty. It is copied by build.cmd into the bin directory as both Directory.Build.props
     and Directory.Build.targets to prevent CMake built projects from dependending on the Directory.Build infrastructure
     in the root of the source tree. In particular this was necessary to compile DacTableGen, which is currently compiled
     against .NET Framework.
