// Restricted callouts refer to calls to classlib defined code written in C# made from the runtime during a
// garbage collection. As such these C# methods are constrained in what they can do and must be written very
// carefully. The most obvious restriction is that they cannot trigger a GC (by attempting to allocate memory
// for example) since that would lead to an immediate deadlock.
//
// Known constraints:
//  * No triggering of GCs (new, boxing value types, foreach over a type that allocates for its IEnumerator,
//    calling GC.Collect etc.).
//  * No exceptions can leak out of the callout.
//  * No blocking (or expensive) operations that could starve the GC or potentially lead to deadlocks.
//  * No use of runtime facilities that check whether a GC is in progress, these will deadlock. The big
//    example we know about so far is making a p/invoke call.
//  * For the AfterMarkPhase callout special attention must be paid to avoid any action that reads the MethodTable*
//    from an object header (e.g. casting). At this point the GC may have mark bits set in the the pointer.
//
