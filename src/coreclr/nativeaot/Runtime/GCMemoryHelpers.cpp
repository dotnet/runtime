// This function clears a piece of memory in a GC safe way.
// Object-aligned memory is zeroed with no smaller than pointer-size granularity.
// We must make this guarantee whenever we clear memory in the GC heap that could contain object
// references.  The GC or other user threads can read object references at any time, clearing them bytewise can result
// in a read on another thread getting incorrect data.
// Unaligned memory at the beginning and remaining bytes at the end are written bytewise.
// USAGE:  The caller is responsible for null-checking the reference.
