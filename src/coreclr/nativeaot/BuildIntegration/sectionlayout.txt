;; section layout file

;;
;; The first thunks section should be 64K aligned because it can get
;; mapped multiple  times in memory, and mapping works on allocation
;; granularity boundaries (we don't want to map more than what we need)
;;
;; The easiest way to do so is by having the thunks section at the 
;; first 64K aligned virtual address in the binary. We provide this section
;; layout file to the linker to tell it how to layout the thunks sections
;; that we care about.
;;
;; The PE spec says images cannot have gaps between sections (other 
;; than what is required by the section alignment value in the header),
;; therefore we need a couple of padding data sections (otherwise the
;; OS will not load the image).
