    /// entry index in the object header, which avoids a hash table lookup. It closely matches
    /// implementation of SyncBlocks.
    ///
    /// SyncTable assigns a unique table entry to each object it is asked for.  The assigned entry
    /// index is stored in the object header and preserved during table expansion (we never shrink
    /// the table).  Each table entry contains a long weak GC handle representing the owner object
    /// of that entry and may be in one of the three states:
    /// 1) Free (IsAllocated == false).  These entries have been either never used or used and
    ///    freed/recycled after their owners died.  We keep a linked list of recycled entries and
    ///    use it to dispense entries to new objects.
    /// 2) Live (Target != null).  These entries store the hash code and the Monitor synchronization
    ///    object assigned to Target.
    /// 3) Dead (Target == null).  These entries lost their owners and are ready to be freed/recycled.
    ///
    /// Here is the state diagram for an entry:
    ///    Free --{AssignEntry}--> Live --{GC}--> Dead --{(Recycle|Free)DeadEntries} --> Free
    ///
    /// The public methods operates on live entries only and acquire the following locks:
    /// * GetLockObject : Lock-free.  We always allocate a Monitor synchronization object before
    ///                   the entry goes live.  The returned object may be used as normal; no
    ///                   additional synchronization required.
    /// * GetHashCode   : Lock-free.  A stale zero value may be returned.
    /// * SetHashCode   : Acquires s_lock.
    /// * AssignEntry   : Acquires s_lock.
    ///
    /// The important part here is that all read operations are lock-free and fast, and write
    /// operations are expected to be much less frequent than read ones.
