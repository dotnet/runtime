    Loop cloning is an optimization which duplicates a loop to create two versions.
    One copy is optimized by hoisting out various dynamic checks, such as array bounds
    checks that can't be statically eliminated. The checks are dynamically run. If
    they fail, the original copy of the loop is executed. If they pass, the
    optimized copy of the loop is executed, knowing that the bounds checks are
    dynamically unnecessary.

    The optimization can reduce the amount of code executed within a loop body.

    For example:

        public static int f(int[] a, int l)
        {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < l; i++)
            {
                sum += a[i];     // This array bounds check must be executed in the loop
            }
        }

    This can be transformed to (in pseudo-code):

        public static int f(int[] a, int l)
        {
            int sum = 0;
            if (a != null && l <= a.Length)
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < l; i++)
                {
                    sum += a[i]; // no bounds check needed
                }
            }
            else
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < l; i++)
                {
                    // bounds check needed. We need to do the normal computation (esp., side effects) before the
exception occurs.
                    sum += a[i];
                }
            }
        }

    One generalization of this is "loop unswitching".

    Because code is duplicated, this is a code size expanding optimization, and
    therefore we need to be careful to avoid duplicating too much code unnecessarily.

    Also, there is a risk that we can duplicate the loops and later, downstream
    phases optimize away the bounds checks even on the un-optimized copy of the loop.

    Loop cloning is implemented with the following steps:

    1. Loop detection logic, which is existing logic in the JIT that records
       loop information with loop flags.

    2. Identify loop optimization candidates. This is done by optObtainLoopCloningOpts.
       The loop context variable is updated with all the necessary information (for example:
       block, stmt, tree information) to do the optimization later.
            a) This involves checking if the loop is well-formed with respect to
            the optimization being performed.
            b) In array bounds check case, reconstructing the morphed GT_INDEX
            nodes back to their array representation.
                i) The array index is stored in the "context" variable with
                additional block, tree, stmt info.

    3. Once the optimization candidates are identified, we derive cloning conditions.
       For example: to clone a simple "for (i=0; i<n; ++i) { a[i] }" loop, we need the
       following conditions:
              (a != null) && (n >= 0) && (n <= a.length) && (stride > 0)
       Note that "&&" implies a short-circuiting operator. This requires each condition
       to be in its own block with its own comparison and branch instruction. This can
       be optimized if there are no dependent conditions in a block by using a bitwise
       AND instead of a short-circuit AND. The (a != null) condition needs to occur before
       "a.length" is checked. But otherwise, the last three conditions can be computed in
       the same block, as:
              (a != null) && ((n >= 0) & (n <= a.length) & (stride > 0))
       Since we're optimizing for the expected fast path case, where all the conditions
       are true, we expect all the conditions to be executed most of the time. Thus, it
       is advantageous to make as many as possible non-short-circuiting to reduce the
       number of compare/branch/blocks needed.

       In the above case, stride == 1, so we statically know stride > 0.

       If we had "for (i=0; i<=n; ++i) { a[i] }", we would need:
              (a != null) && (n >= 0) && (a.length >= 1) && (n <= a.length - 1) && (stride > 0)
       This is more complicated. The loop is equivalent (except for possible overflow) to:
              for (i=0; i<n+1; ++i) { a[i] }"
       (`n+1` due to the `++i` stride). We'd have to worry about overflow doing this conversion, though.

       REVIEW: why do we need the (n >= 0) condition? We do need to know
       "array index var initialization value >= array lower bound (0)".

              a) Conditions that need to be in their own blocks to enable short-circuit are called block
              conditions or deref-conditions.
                 i) For a doubly nested loop on i, j, we would then have conditions like
                     (a != null) && (i < a.len) && (a[i] != null) && (j < a[i].len)
                 all short-circuiting creating blocks.

                 Advantage:
                    All conditions are checked before we enter the fast path. So fast
                    path gets as fast as it can be.

                 Disadvantage:
                    Creation of blocks.

                 Heuristic:
                    Therefore we will not clone if we exceed creating 4 blocks.
                    Note: this means we never clone more than 2-dimension a[i][j] expressions
                    (see optComputeDerefConditions()).
                    REVIEW: make this heuristic defined by a COMPlus variable, for easier
                    experimentation, and make it more dynamic and based on potential benefit?

              b) The other conditions called cloning conditions are transformed into LC_Condition
              structs which are then optimized.
                 i) Optimization of conditions involves removing redundant condition checks.
                 ii) If some conditions evaluate to true statically, then they are removed.
                 iii) If any condition evaluates to false statically, then loop cloning is
                 aborted for that loop.

    4. Then the block splitting occurs and loop cloning conditions are transformed into
       GenTree and added to the loop cloning choice block (the block that determines which
       copy of the loop is executed).

    Preconditions

    1. Loop detection has completed and the loop table is populated.

    2. The loops that will be considered are the ones with the LPFLG_ITER flag:
       "for (i = icon or lclVar; test_condition(); i++)"

    Limitations

    1. For array based optimizations the loop choice condition is checked
       before the loop body. This implies that the loop initializer statement
       has not executed at the time of the check. So any loop cloning condition
       involving the initial value of the loop counter cannot be condition checked
       as it hasn't been assigned yet at the time of condition checking. Therefore
       the initial value has to be statically known. This can be fixed with further
       effort.

    2. Loops containing nested exception handling regions are not cloned. (Cloning them
       would require creating new exception handling regions for the cloned loop, which
       is "hard".) There are a few other EH-related edge conditions that also cause us to
       reject cloning.

    3. If the loop contains RETURN blocks, and cloning those would push us over the maximum
       number of allowed RETURN blocks in the function (either due to GC info encoding limitations
       or otherwise), we reject cloning.

    4. Loop increment must be `i += 1`

    5. Loop test must be `i < x` where `x` is a constant, a variable, or `a.Length` for array `a`

    (There is some implementation support for decrementing loops, but it is incomplete.
    There is some implementation support for `i <= x` conditions, but it is incomplete
    (Compiler::optDeriveLoopCloningConditions() only handles GT_LT conditions))

    6. Loop must have been converted to a do-while form.

    7. There are a few other loop well-formedness conditions.

    8. Multi-dimensional (non-jagged) loop index checking is only partially implemented.

    9. Constant initializations and constant limits must be non-negative (REVIEW: why? The
       implementation does use `unsigned` to represent them.)

    10. The cloned loop (the slow path) is not added to the loop table, meaning certain
       downstream optimization passes do not see them. See
       https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/43713.

    Assumptions

    1. The assumption is that the optimization candidates collected during the
       identification phase will be the ones that will be optimized. In other words,
       the loop that is present originally will be the fast path. The cloned
       path will be the slow path and will be unoptimized. This allows us to
       collect additional information at the same time as identifying the optimization
       candidates. This later helps us to perform the optimizations during actual cloning.

    2. All loop cloning choice conditions will automatically be "AND"-ed. These are bitwise AND operations.

    3. Perform short circuit AND for (array != null) side effect check
      before hoisting (limit <= a.length) check.
