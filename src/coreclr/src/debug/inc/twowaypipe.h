// This file contains definition of a simple IPC mechanism - bidirectional named pipe.
// It is implemented on top of two one-directional names pipes (fifos on UNIX)

// One Windows it is possible to ask OS to create a bidirectional pipe, but it is not the case on UNIX.
// In order to unify implementation we use two pipes on all systems.

// This all methods of this class are *NOT* thread safe: it is assumed the caller provides synchronization at a higher level.
