 DbgTransportSession was originally designed around cross-machine debugging via sockets and it is supposed to 
 handle network interruptions. Right now we use pipes (see TwoWaypipe) and don't expect to have connection issues.
 But there seem to be no good reason to try hard to get rid of existing working protocol even if it's a bit 
 cautious about connection quality. So please KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME COMMENTS REFERING TO NETWORK AND SOCKETS
 CAN BE OUTDATED.

//
// Provides a robust and secure transport session between a debugger and a debuggee that are potentially on
// different machines.
//
// The following terminology is used for the wire protocol. The smallest meaningful entity written to or read
// from the connection is a "message". This consists of one or maybe two "blocks" where a block is a
// contiguous region of memory in the host machine. The first block is always a "message header" which is
// fixed size (allowing the receiver to know how many bytes to read off the stream oriented connection) and
// has type codes and other fields which the receiver can use to determine if another block is part of the
// message (and if so, exactly how large that block is). Many management messages consist only of a message
// header block, while operations such as sending a debugger event structure involve a message header followed
// by a block containing the actual event structure.
//
// Message acknowledgement (sometimes abbreviated to ack) refers to a system of marking all messages with an
// ID and noting and reporting which IDs we've seen from our peer. We piggy back the highest seen ID on all
// outgoing messages and this is used by the infrastructure to communicate the fact that a sender can release
// its copy of an outbound message since it successfully made it across the communications channel and won't
// need to be resent in the case of a network failure.
//
// This file uses the debugger conventions for naming the two endpoints of the session: the left side or LS is
// the side with the runtime while the right side (RS) is the side with the debugger.
//

// The structure of this file necessitates a certain number of forward references (particularly in the
// comments). If you see a term you don't understand please do a search for it further down the file, where
// hopefully you will find a detailed definition (and if not, please add one).
