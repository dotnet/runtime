#define _EVENT_CHANNEL_H_

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This is the abstract base class for the old-style "IPC" event channel.  (Despite the name, these events are 
// no longer transmitted in an IPC shared memory block.)  The event channel owns the DebuggerIPCControlBlock.
//
// Assumptions:
//    This class is NOT thread-safe.  Caller is assumed to have taken the appropriate measures for 
//    synchronization.
//    
// Notes:
//    In Whidbey, both LS-to-RS and RS-to-LS communication are done by IPC shared memory block.  We allocate
//    a DebuggerIPCControlBlock (DCB) on the IPC shared memory block.  The DCB contains both a send buffer
//    and a receive buffer (from the perspective of the LS, e.g. the send buffer is for LS-to-RS communication).
//    
//    In the new architecture, LS-to-RS communication is mostly done by raising an exception on the LS and 
//    calling code:INativeEventPipeline::WaitForDebugEvent on the RS.  This communication is handled by
//    code:INativeEventPipeline.  RS-to-LS communication is mostly done by calling into the code:IDacDbiInterface,
//    which on Windows is just a structured way to do ReadProcessMemory().
//    
//    There are still cases where we are sending IPC events in not-yet-DACized code.  There are two main 
//    categories:
//    
//    1) There are three types of events which the RS can send to the LS:
//       a) asynchronous: the RS can just send the event and continue
//       b) synchronous, but no reply: the RS must wait for an acknowledgement, but there is no reply
//       c) synchronous, reply required: the RS must wait for an acknowledgement before it can get the reply
//       
//       For (c), the RS sends a synchronous IPC event to the LS and wait for a reply.  The reply is returned 
//       in the same buffer space used to send the event, i.e. in the receive buffer.
//         - RS: code:CordbRCEventThread::SendIPCEvent
//         - LS: code:DebuggerRCThread::SendIPCReply
//       
//    2) In the case where the information from the LS has a variable size (and so we are not sure if it will
//       fit in one event), the RS sends an asynchronous IPC event to the LS and wait for one or more 
//       events from the LS.  The events from the LS are actually sent using the native pipeline.  This is
//       somewhat tricky because we need to make sure the event from the native pipeline is passed along to 
//       the thread which is waiting for the IPC events from the LS.  (For more information, see how we use
//       code:CordbProcess::m_leftSideEventAvailable and code:CordbProcess::m_leftSideEventRead).  Currently, 
//       the only place where we use send IPC events this way is in the inspection code used to check the 
//       results from the DAC against the results from the IPC events.
//         - RS: code:Cordb::WaitForIPCEventFromProcess
//         - LS: code:DebuggerRCThread::SendIPCEvent
//
//    In a sense, you can think of the LS and the RS sharing 3 channels: one for debug events (see 
//    code:INativeEventPipeline), one for DDI calls (see code:IDacDbiInterface), 
//    and one for "IPC" events.  This is the interface for the "IPC" events.
