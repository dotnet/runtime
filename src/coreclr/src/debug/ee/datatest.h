#ifndef DATA_TEST_H
#define DATA_TEST_H

// This class is used to test our ability to detect from the RS when the target has taken a lock.
// When the DAC executes a code path that takes a lock, we need to know if the target is holding it. 
// If it is, then we assume that the locked data is in an inconsistent state. In that case, we don't 
// want to report the data; we just want to throw an exception.
// This functionality in this class lets us take a lock on the LS and then signal the RS to try to 
// detect whether the lock is held. The main function in this class is TestDataSafety. It deterministically
// signals the RS at key points to execute a code path that takes a lock and also passes a flag to indicate
// whether the LS actually holds the lock. With this information, we can ascertain that our lock detection
// code is working correctly. Without this special test function, it would be nearly impossible to test this
// in any kind of deterministic way.
// 
// The test will run in either debug or retail builds, as long as the environment variable TestDataConsistency
// is turned on. It runs once in code:Debugger::Startup. The RS part of the test is in the cases
// DB_IPCE_TEST_CRST and DB_IPCE_TEST_RWLOCK in code:CordbProcess::RawDispatchEvent.
