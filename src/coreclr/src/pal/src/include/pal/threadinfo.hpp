    // There are a number of different functional areas for which we need to
    // store per-thread data:
    // * synchronization
    // * structure exception handling
    // * asynchronous procedure calls
    // * thread suspension
    // * thread-local storage
    // * CRT per-thread buffers
    //
    // For each of the above functional areas we build a class that stores
    // the necessary data. An instance of each of these classes is embedded
    // in the main thread class. The classes must not have any failure paths
    // in their constructors. Each class inherits from a common parent class
    // that exposes two virtual initialization routines (which may return an
    // error). The first initialization routine is called after the thread
    // object is allocated, but before the new thread is created. Any
    // initialization that is not dependant on knowledge of the new thread's
    // ID (and by extension need not run in the context of the new thread)
    // should take place in the first routine. Work that must run in the
    // context of the new thread or that must know the new thread's ID
    // should take place in the second initialization routine.
