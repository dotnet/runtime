Function = LockFile
Name = Positive test for LockFile API
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test5
EXE2 = helper
Description
= Have two processes obtain a lock on a single file, but in different
= regions of the file.  Use Read/Write to ensure the locks are respected.
= This requires some IPC, which is done here with a crude busy wait on a 
= file (waiting for the file size to change) to avoid too many more
= dependencies.
