// So we explicitly use the /var/tmp that cannot be on tmpfs, since it it persistent over reboots.

     * An application must meet certain requirements when working 
     * with files opened with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING: 
     *      File access must begin at byte offsets within the file that 
     *      are integer multiples of the volume's sector size. To determine a 
     *      volume's sector size, call the GetDiskFreeSpace function. 
     *
     *      File access must be for numbers of bytes that are integer 
     *      multiples of the volume's sector size. For example, if the
     *      sector size is 512 bytes, an application can request reads and 
     *      writes of 512, 1024, or 2048 bytes, but not of 335, 981, or 7171 bytes. 
     *
     *      Buffer addresses for read and write operations must be sector 
     *      aligned (aligned on addresses in memory that are integer multiples 
     *      of the volume's sector size). One way to sector align buffers is to use the 
     *      VirtualAlloc function to allocate the buffers. This function allocates memory 
     *      that is aligned on addresses that are integer multiples of the system's page size. 
     *      Because both page and volume sector sizes are powers of 2, memory aligned by multiples 
     *      of the system's page size is also aligned by multiples of the volume's sector size.
