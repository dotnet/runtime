Section = C Runtime
Function = iswdigit
Name = Positive Test for iswdigit
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test1
Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the iswdigit function.
= Tests the passed parameter to iswdigit for being a 
= digit ('0' - '9'). Also passes non-digits to make sure
= iswdigit picks them up. 
= NOTE: There are three ASCII values that under Windows,
= iswdigit will return non-zero, indicating a digit. 
= These values are quite apparently not digits:
= 178, 179, 185. These are not tested.
