Function = fdopen
Name = test for fdopen and _close
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test1
Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the fdopen function. 
= This will test fdopen in r (read) mode. This test 
= creates and opens a test pipe, to write and read 
= from. fdopen requires a file handle(int), therefore
= _open_osfhandle is used to get that handle. 
= _open_osfhandle is only used with CreatePipe. The 
= test will write and read from the pipe comparing 
= the results.
= As a secondary test, _close is tested since it needs
= the handle returned by _open_osfhandle. The handle is
= closed, then a read is attempted on the handle which 
= should fail.
