** Source:  test2.c
**
** Purpose: Tests the PAL implementation of the fread function.
**          Open a file in READ mode, and then try to read all
**          the characters, more than all the characters,
**          0 characters and 0 sized characters and check that
**          the strings read in are correct.
**
** Depends:
**     fopen
**     fseek
**     fclose
**     strcmp
**     memset
**
