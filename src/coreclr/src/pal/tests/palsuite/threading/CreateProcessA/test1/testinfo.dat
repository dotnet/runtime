Description 
= Test the CreateProcessA function.  The test executes the childprocess 
= program.  The childprocess program launches and writes a const char string
= to a file childdata.  The parent waits for the completion of childprocess
= and then reads the string from the childdata file.  If the string in the 
= file matches it's copy of the const char string, then the test succeeds.
