Description 
= Test that we are able to nest critical section calls.  
= The initial thread makes a call to EnterCriticalSection once, 
= blocking on a CRITICAL_SECTION object and creates a new thread.  
= The newly created thread blocks on the same CRITICAL_SECTION object.
= The first thread now makes a call to LeaveCriticalSection.
= Test to see that the new thread doesn't get unblocked.
