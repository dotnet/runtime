Description 
= Purpose: Test to ensure that OpenEventW() works when
= opening an event created by another process. This test
= program launches a child process which creates a
= named, initially-unset event. The child waits up to
= 10 seconds for the parent process to open that event
= and set it, and returns PASS if the event was set or FAIL
= otherwise. The parent process checks the return value
= from the child to verify that the opened event was
= properly used across processes.
