Name = Test for nested PAL_EXCEPT_FILTER_EX & EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH
Type = DEFAULT 
EXE1 = pal_except_filter
LANG = cpp
Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the PAL_EXCEPT_FILTER_EX. An 
= exception is forced and passed to two nested exception filters for
= consideration.  The first filter returns EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH
= so the second can run and return EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER.  The 
= initial exception handler should be skipped, and the second 
= executed
