# C to MASM include file translator
# This is replacement for the deprecated h2inc tool that used to be part of VS.

#
# The use of [console]::WriteLine (instead of Write-Output) is intentional.
# PowerShell 2.0 (installed by default on Windows 7) wraps lines written with
# Write-Output at whatever column width is being used by the current terminal,
# even when output is being redirected to a file. We can't have this behavior
# because it will cause the generated file to be malformed.
