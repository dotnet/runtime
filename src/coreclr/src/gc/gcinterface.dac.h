// This file defines the interface between the GC and the DAC. The interface consists of two things:
//   1. A number of variables ("DAC vars") whose addresses are exposed to the DAC (see "struct GcDacVars")
//   2. A number of types that are analogues to GC-internal types. These types expose a subset of the
//      GC-internal type's fields, while still maintaining the same layout.
// This interface is strictly versioned, see gcinterface.dacvars.def for more information.
