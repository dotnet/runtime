// ICorJitCompilerImpl: declare for implementation all the members of the ICorJitCompiler interface (which are
// specified as pure virtual methods). This is done once, here, and all implementations share it,
// to avoid duplicated declarations. This file is #include'd within all the ICorJitCompiler implementation
// classes.
//
// NOTE: this file is in exactly the same order, with exactly the same whitespace, as the ICorJitCompiler
// interface declaration (with the "virtual" and "= 0" syntax removed). This is to make it easy to compare
// against the interface declaration.

public:
// compileMethod is the main routine to ask the JIT Compiler to create native code for a method. The
// method to be compiled is passed in the 'info' parameter, and the code:ICorJitInfo is used to allow the
// JIT to resolve tokens, and make any other callbacks needed to create the code. nativeEntry, and
// nativeSizeOfCode are just for convenience because the JIT asks the EE for the memory to emit code into
// (see code:ICorJitInfo.allocMem), so really the EE already knows where the method starts and how big
// it is (in fact, it could be in more than one chunk).
//
// * In the 32 bit jit this is implemented by code:CILJit.compileMethod
// * For the 64 bit jit this is implemented by code:PreJit.compileMethod
//
// Note: Obfuscators that are hacking the JIT depend on this method having __stdcall calling convention
