// ComEventsFeature
//
// ComEventsFeature defines two public methods allowing to add/remove .NET delegates handling
// events from COM objects. Those methods are defined as part of ComEventsHelper static class
// * ComEventsHelper.Combine - will create/reuse-an-existing COM event sink and register the
//     specified delegate to be raised when corresponding COM event is raised
// * ComEventsHelper.Remove
//
// ComEventsArchitecture:
// In COM world, events are handled by so-called event sinks. These are COM-based Object Models
// (OMs) that define "source" interfaces that need to be implemented by COM clients to receive events. So,
// event sinks are COM objects implementing source interfaces. Once an event sink is passed to the COM
// server (through a mechanism known as 'binding/advising to connection point'), COM server will be
// calling source interface methods to "fire events".
// See https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/connection-points
//
// There are few interesting obervations about source interfaces. Usually source interfaces are defined
// as 'dispinterface' - meaning that only late-bound invocations on this interface are allowed. Even
// though it is not illegal to use early bound invocations on source interfaces - the practice is
// discouraged because of versioning concerns.
//
// Notice also that each COM server object might define multiple source interfaces and hence have
// multiple connection points (each CP handles exactly one source interface). COM objects that want to
// fire events are required to implement the IConnectionPointContainer interface which is used by COM
// clients to discovery connection points - objects implementing IConnectionPoint interface. Once a
// connection point is found - clients can bind to it using IConnectionPoint::Advise (see
// ComEventsSink.Advise).
//
// The idea behind ComEventsFeature is to write a "universal event sink" COM component that is
// generic enough to handle all late-bound event firings and invoke corresponding COM delegates (through
// reflection).
//
// When delegate is registered (using ComEventsHelper.Combine) we will verify we have corresponding
// event sink created and bound.
//
// When COM events are fired, ComEventsSink.Invoke implements IDispatch and the Invoke method
// is the entry point that is called. Once our event sink is invoked, we need to find the
// corresponding delegate to invoke. We need to match the dispid of the call that is coming in to a
// dispid of .NET delegate that has been registered for this object. Once this is found we call the
// delegates using reflection (see ComEventsMethod.Invoke).
//
// ComEventsArgsMarshalling
// Notice, that we may not have a delegate registered against every method on the source interface. If we
// were to marshal all the input parameters for methods that do not reach user code - we would end up
// generatic RCWs that are not reachable for user code (the inconvenience it might create is there will
// be RCWs that users can not call Marshal.ReleaseComObject on to explicitly manage the lifetime of these
// COM objects). The above behavior was one of the shortcomings of legacy TLBIMP's implementation of COM
// event sinking. In our code we will not marshal any data if there is no delegate registered to handle
// the event. (see ComEventsMethod.Invoke)
//
// ComEventsFinalization:
// Additional area of interest is when COM sink should be unadvised from the connection point. Legacy
// TLBIMP's implementation of COM event sinks will unadvises the sink when corresponding RCW is GCed.
// This is achieved by rooting the event sinks in a finalizable object stored in RCW's property bag
// (using Marshal.SetComObjectData). Hence, once RCW is no longer reachable - the finalizer is called and
// it would unadvise all the event sinks. We are employing the same strategy here. See storing an
// instance in the RCW at ComEventsInfo.FromObject and unadvising the sinks in ComEventsInfo.~ComEventsInfo
//
// Classes of interest:
// * ComEventsHelpers - defines public methods but there are also a number of internal classes that
//     implement the actual COM event sink
// * ComEventsInfo - represents a finalizable container for all event sinks for a particular RCW.
//     Lifetime of this instance corresponds to the lifetime of the RCW object
// * ComEventsSink - represents a single event sink. Maintains an internal pointer to the next
//     instance (in a singly linked list). A collection of ComEventsSink is stored at
//     ComEventsInfo._sinks
// * ComEventsMethod - represents a single method from the source interface which has .NET delegates
//     attached to it. Maintains an internal pointer to the next instance (in a singly linked list). A
//     collection of ComEventMethod is stored at ComEventsSink._methods
//
// ComEventsRetValIssue:
// Issue: normally, COM events would not return any value. However, it may happen as described in
// http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810228. Such design might represent a problem for us - e.g. what is
// the return value of a chain of delegates - is it the value of the last call in the chain or the the
// first one? As the above KB article indicates, in cases where OM has events returning values, it is
// suggested that people implement their event sink by explicitly implementing the source interface. This
// means that the problem is already quite complex and we should not be dealing with it - see
// ComEventsMethod.Invoke
