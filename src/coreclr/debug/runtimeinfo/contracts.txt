# algorithmic contracts for coreclr
# The format of this file is:
#   # comment
#   CONTRACT NAME, VERSION #optional trailing comment
#
# CONTRACT NAME is an arbitrary string, VERSION is an integer
#
# cdac-build-tool can take multiple "-c contract_file" arguments
# so to conditionally include contracts, put optional contracts in a separate file
SOSBreakingChangeVersion, 1 # example contract: runtime exports an SOS breaking change version global
