  <!-- 
    Works around the fact that the Content items defined in crossgen2.props get cleaned 
    after subsequent build runs. Without this target, the build will fail when we 
    try to use the inbuild crossgen as it will try to look for native libs that aren't there.

    Unsure if this is a bug in the SDK or if we are doing something wrong. Warrants more investigation.
