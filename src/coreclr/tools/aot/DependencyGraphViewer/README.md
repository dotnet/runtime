#Why use this tool?
If you are developing with NativeAOT or using the Linker, you might ask yourself: why is this file being kept after trimming? Sometimes, it can be unclear why certain methods are retained after a self-contained application is trimmed. This tool can help devs understand why your program keeps files.
