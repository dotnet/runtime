; Define the set of instruction sets available on a platform
; Format is
;
; Add new instruction set
; instructionset,<architecture>,<managed name>,<r2r name if different>,<R2R numeric value>, <jit instruction set name>, <public name>
;
; The public name is intended to match with mono for specifying what the name of the instruction set is. These names match names produced by other compilers as well.
;
; Add jit 64bit architecture specific instruction set when instruction set is available
; instructionset64bit,<architecture>,<jit instruction set name>
;
; Note that a instruction set is a "Vector" instruction set. A vector instruction set may only imply a single other instruction set
; vectorinstructionset,<architecture>,<jit instruction set name>
;
; Add an instruction set implication (i.e, if instruction set A is present, then instruction set B must be present too.)
; implication,<architecture>,<jit instruction set name>,<implied jit instruction set name>
;
; Copy instruction sets defined for other architecture at this point in the file.
; copyinstructionsets,<architecture>,<copytoarchitecture>

; UPDATE JIT/EE INTERFACE GUID WHEN CHANGING THESE DEFINITIONS. The instruction set definitions are part of JIT/EE interface contract.

; DO NOT CHANGE R2R NUMERIC VALUES OF THE EXISTING SETS. Changing R2R numeric values definitions would be R2R format breaking change.

; need F, BW, CD, DQ, and VL to be fully functional without adding
; significant complexity into the JIT. Additionally, unlike AVX/AVX2
; there was never really any hardware that didn't provide all 5 at
; once, with the notable exception being Knight's Landing which
; provided a similar but not quite the same feature.
