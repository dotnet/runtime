    opened or closed or until another call to tracepoint_connect.

    - tp_state is the tracepoint to be connected. It is ok to specify a

      tracepoint will be disconnected from the old provider (if any) and
      connected to the new one.

      to specify NULL - the tracepoint will be disconnected and reset. It is ok

      closed provider until it opens, at which point the tracepoint will be
      disconnected and reset (this behavior is necessary for init-on-first-use
