// DacEnumerableHash is an base class using the "Curiously recurring template pattern"
// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern)
// designed to factor out the functionality common to hash tables that are captured during DAC memory enumeration
//
// SEMANTICS
//
//  * Arbitrary entry payload via payload.
//  * 32-bit hash code for entries.
//  * Separate entry allocation and insertion (allowing reliable insertion if required).
//  * Enumerate all entries or entries matching a particular hash.
//  * No entry deletion.
//  * Base logic to support DAC memory enumeration of the hash (including per-entry tweaks as needed).
//  * Lock free lookup (the caller must follow the protocol laid out below under USER REQUIREMENTS).
//  * Automatic hash expansion (with dialable scale factor).
//
// BENEFITS
//
//  * Provides built-in DAC memory enumeration with optional per-entry customization for any size of hash entry.
//  * Factors out common code:
//      o Less chance of bugs, one place to make fixes.
//      o Less code overall.
//
// SUB-CLASSING REQUIREMENTS
//
// To author a new DacEnumerableHash-based hashtable, the following steps are required:
//  1) In most cases (where each hash entry will have multiple fields) a structure defining the hash entry
//     should be declared (see EEClassHashEntry in ClassHash.h for an example). This structure need not
//     include a field for the hash code or pointer to the next entry in the hash bucket; these are taken care
//     of automatically by the base class.
//  2) Declare your new hash class deriving from DacEnumerableHash and providing the following template parameters:
//      FINAL_CLASS  : The class you're declaring (this is used by the base class to locate certain helper
//                     methods in your class used to tweak hash behavior).
//      VALUE        : The type of your hash entries (the class defined in the previous step).
//      SCALE_FACTOR : A multiplier on bucket count every time the hash table is grown (currently once the
//                     number of hash entries exceeds twice the number of buckets). A value of 2 would double
//                     the number of buckets on each grow operation for example.
//  3) Define a constructor that invokes the base class constructor with various setup parameters (see
//     DacEnumerableHash constructor in this header). If your hash table is created via a static method rather than
//     direct construction (common) then call your constructor using an in-place new inside the static method
//     (see EEClassHashTable::Create in ClassHash.cpp for an example).
//  4) Define your basic hash functionality (creation, insertion, lookup, enumeration, and DAC
//     memory enumeration) using the Base* methods provided by DacEnumerableHash.
//  5) The following methods can be defined on the derived class to customize the DAC memory enumeration:
//
//          void EnumMemoryRegionsForEntry(EEClassHashEntry_t *pEntry, CLRDataEnumMemoryFlags flags);
//              Called during EnumMemoryRegions for each entry in the hash. Use to enumerate any memory
//              referenced by the entry (but not the entry itself, that is already done by EnumMemoryRegions).
//
// USER REQUIREMENTS
//
// Synchronization: It is permissable to read data from the hash without taking a lock as long as:
//  1) Any hash modifications are performed under a lock or otherwise serialized.
//  2) Any miss on a lookup is handled by taking a lock are retry-ing the lookup.
//
// OVERALL DESIGN
//
// The table must cope with entry insertions and growing the
// bucket list when the table becomes too loaded (too many entries causing excessive bucket collisions). This
// happens when an entry insertion notes that there are twice as many entries as buckets. The bucket list is
// then reallocated (from a loader heap, consequently the old one is leaked) and resized based on a scale
// factor supplied by the hash sub-class.
//

// The type used to contain an entry hash value. This is not customizable on a per-hash class basis: all
// DacEnumerableHash derived hashes will share the same definition. Note that we only care about the data size, and the
// fact that it is an unsigned integer value (so we can take a modulus for bucket computation and use bitwise
// equality checks). The base class does not care about or participate in how these hash values are calculated.
