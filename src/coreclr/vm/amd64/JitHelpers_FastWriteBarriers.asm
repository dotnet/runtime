; Two super fast helpers that together do the work of JIT_WriteBarrier.  These
; use inlined ephemeral region bounds and an inlined pointer to the card table.
;
; Until the GC does some major reshuffling, the ephemeral region will always be
; at the top of the heap, so given that we know the reference is inside the
; heap, we don't have to check against the upper bound of the ephemeral region
; (PreGrow version).  Once the GC moves the ephemeral region, this will no longer
; be valid, so we use the PostGrow version to check both the upper and lower
; bounds. The inlined bounds and card table pointers have to be patched
; whenever they change.
;
; At anyone time, the memory pointed to by JIT_WriteBarrier will contain one
; of these functions.  See StompWriteBarrierResize and StompWriteBarrierEphemeral
; in VM\AMD64\JITInterfaceAMD64.cpp and InitJITHelpers1 in VM\JITInterfaceGen.cpp
; for more info.
;
; READ THIS!!!!!!
; it is imperative that the addresses of of the values that we overwrite
; (card table, ephemeral region ranges, etc) are naturally aligned since
; there are codepaths that will overwrite these values while the EE is running.
