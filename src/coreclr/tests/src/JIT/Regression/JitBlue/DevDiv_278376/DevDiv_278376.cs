// NOTE: the bug for this test was an assertion in RyuJIT/x86 when generating code for a double-returning call that
//       was spilled by the RA and subsequently used. The call in question is the call to `C.GetDouble` in `C.Test`.
//       To ensure that its return value is spilled, `C.GetDouble` is implemented as a P/Invoke method: the return
//       value ends up spilled because there is a call to `TrapReturningThreads` between the call and the use of the
//       return value by the cast. Because the bug is a simple assert, there is no need for the problematic code to
//       actually run, so the implementation of `GetDouble` does not need to actually exist.
