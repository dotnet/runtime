/*
 * Some comments about the test:
 * Expected: The code runs and completes successfully.
 * Acutal: The application hangs when it is run.
 * The csharp compiler seems to be generating the same IL in both the cases.
 *
 * Some comments about the bug:
 * The problem is that the way we use ComputePreferredZapModule grows exponentially in this test case.  The thing with the inliner is a red herring.  If you increase the constant from 5 to 15 it also hangs.  The only reason that it's worse with the inliner is because of the way we handle the unbounded recursion.  Once you get about 5 deep you go all the way infinitely (because the call site size is always smaller than the estimated function body).
