/*
 * Assertion prop was not taking into account the fact that +0.0 and -0.0 compare equal but are not the same value.
 * Just need to turn of assertion prop for all floating point because equality doesn't mean the same...
 * Notes from initial investigations:
 * Calling IsNegativeZero the first time returns true, the second time false.
 * The first call to IsNegativeZero is getting inlined and the second call is not.
 * It appears the code for the non-inlined method is wrong which is how we end up with two different results for the same call with the same arg.
 * It seems that if you compile with /debug we get correct code so I’m thinking the problem is with inlining DoubleToInt64Bits into IsNegativeZero.
