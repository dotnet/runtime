// This test makes sure that Exchange(object, object)
// plays nicely with other threads accessing shared state directly.
// The test spawns a bunch of threads, then each thread tries to 
// grab the mutex (set location=1), decrement a global resource count, 
// then release the mutex (set location=0).  While location=0, the 
// thread will be able to set it to 1 and enter the mutex to consume 
// the resource, but if it is 1, the thread will be denied entry.
// At the end, the test checks that:
// the sum of all entries + denials = total potential resources
// total potential resources = resources unconsumed + entries
