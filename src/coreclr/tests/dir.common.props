  <!-- This file contains common build properties for projects under
       the test tree, and also generated test projects in
       bin/tests. It currently has only those properties that are
       shared between old-style test projects and SDK-style test
       projects. Eventually every test project should build using the
       SDK. Some test projects still bypass this by importing
       tests/dir.props directly - these should eventually go away. -->
