Disabled Test Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a list of all disabled test cases currently listed in
testconfig.dat and an explanation as to why they are disabled.

debug_api/debugbreak/test1
debug_api/outputdebugstringa/test1
debug_api/outputdebugstringw/test1
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test1
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test3
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test4
=======================================
The above testcases were disabled in the palsuite, because they depend heavily on
WaitForDebugEvent,DebugActiveProcess and ContinueDebugEvent, where these api's
have been removed from the PAL.


file_io/gettempfilenamea/test2 :
=======================================
This test takes longer than 60 seconds to run. The test creates
about 65000 files and then deletes them. The test that takes longer
than 60 seconds will be flagged as an error and so in such a case
the test will have to be run manually.

file_io/gettempfilenamew/test2 :
=======================================
This test takes longer than 60 seconds to run. The test creates
about 65000 files and then deletes them. The test that takes longer
than 60 seconds will be flagged as an error and so in such a case
the test will have to be run manually.

locale_info/getcpinfo/test2:
=======================================
This test will be useful in future versions for testing various
languages (code pages).  Currently only U.S. English (tested by -
test1) is supported.

locale_info/getcpinfo/test3:
=======================================
This test will be useful in future versions for testing various
languages (code pages).  Currently only U.S. English (tested by -
