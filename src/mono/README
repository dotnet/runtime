This is Mono.

A directory roadmap:

	doc/
		Contains documentation and the web site contents.

	mono/
		The core of the executable.

		metadata/
			The library to deal with executables and libraries for
			.NET

		dis/
			CIL executable Disassembler

		cli/
			Common code for the JIT and the interpreter.

		cil/
			Common Intermediate Representation, XML
			definition of the CIL bytecodes.

		interp/
			Interpreter for CLI executables.

* Using Mono

	Once you have installed the software, you can run a few programs:

		monodis program.exe

	That will dump the bytecodes for program.exe.  Monodis support
	a number of options that dumps various metadata tables
	(chapter 23 of the Partition III).

	You can try the interpreter like this:

		mono-int program.exe
