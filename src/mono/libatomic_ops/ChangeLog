	Fix various acquire_release_volatile.h files to reflect the fact
	that both icc and gcc seem to reorder ordinary memory accesses around
	volatile accesses early in the compilation. Modify the acquire
	release test to catch this problem (with high probablity, and only on
	a multiprocessor).

2005-03	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	Fixes for recently introduced bugs.  Update x86 and x86-64 assembly
	syntax to deal with complaints by some recent gcc versions.
	
2005-02	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	Added libatomic_ops_gpl library with support for mostly
	lock-free stack and malloc().

2005-01 Ian Wienand <ianw@gelato.unsw.edu.au>, Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>,
	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	Use autoconf, automake, starting with code from Debian package.
	Don't use libtool.

2005-01	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* test_and_set_t_is_ao_t.h, test_and_set_t_is_char.h, others:
	Change most platforms to use byte-wide test-and-set locations.
	
2005-01	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* ao_t_is_int.h: Add to trivially support int-wide operations
	on platforms with int-sized pointers.

2004-12	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* gcc/powerpc.h: First serious attempt to support PowerPC (with
	help from Maged Michael and others).

2004-12	Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* sunc/sparc.[hS]: Added minimal supprt for the Sun SPARC compiler.
	* atomic_ops_sysdeps.S: Add support for platforms that require
	out-of-line assmebly code.

2004-10 Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	More work on char, short, int sized data.  Add both
	compare_double_and_swap_double and compare_and_swap_double.
	Typically each platform will provide at most one of these.

2004-07-02 Ranko Zivojnovic
	Replace both instances of AO_HAVE_NOP_FULL with AO_HAVE_nop_full.

2004-06 Hans Boehm <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	Start to add atomic_ops primitives for different sized data.

2003-12-18  Hans Boehm  <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* atomic_ops/sysdeps/acquire_release_volatile.h, atomic_ops.h:
	Fix support for ecc on IA64.  Remove compiler_barrier workaround
	for gcc 3.4 and later.

2003-12-17  Hans Boehm  <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>
	* atomic_ops/sysdeps/hpc/{ia64.h,hppa.h},
	atomic_ops/sysdeps/msftc/x86.h, Makefile, Makefile.atomic_ops,
	Makefile.atomic_ops.msft, atomic_ops.h: Add initial support
	for atomic_ops for VC++/Windows/X86 and HP/UX with the HP
	compiler on PA_RISC and IA64.

2003-12-09  Hans Boehm  <Hans.Boehm@hp.com>

	* many: Install under "atomic_ops" instead of "ao".
	Change atomic_ops include file structure.  Auxiliary include
	files are all under include/atomic_ops.
	Fix (hopefully) "make dist" in atomic_ops distribution.
	Renamed various types to end in _t, though the old versions
	are still defined for backward compatibility.

2003-12-08  Carlos O'Donell  <carlos@baldric.uwo.ca>

	* ao_sysdeps/gcc/hppa.h: Define AO_CLEAR macro. Change 
	AO_pa_clearable_loc type. Add __ldcw, and __ldcw_align
	helper macros. AO_test_and_set_full uses helper macros.


Started sometime after version 0.4 release.  Currently the format is
informal.  Eventually should become more GNU-like.
