* Software Availability

	The Virtual Execution System is available in package `mono'.
	Currently this contains a metadata library and the
	disassembler.  Please reffer to our <a
	href="runtime.html">Runtime</a> description for more details
	on this part of the project.

	The code for the C# compiler as well as the language error
	test suite and the class library are in the `mcs' package, we
	will move this later into `mono' itself. 

	The mcs compiler requires the `jay' parser generator, this is
	available in module `jay'.

** Sources

	Currently we will be providing CVS snapshots every day, until
	we make the first tarball release.

** CVS

	We are trying to figure out where to put our CVS repository.
	We are debating between the GNOME CVS or SourceForge.  Watch
	this spot.
