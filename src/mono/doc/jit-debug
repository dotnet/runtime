* Debugging information

	Compile your programs using the `-g' flag in MCS, that will generate a file
	with the extension .dbg containing the dwarf symbols for your executable.

	To get stack traces with line number information, you need to run your 
	program like this:

	<b>
	mono --debug program.exe
	</b>

	Notice that the program will need to be compiled with the -g
	flag and that running with --debug will slow down the execution.

* Mono Debugger 

	The Mono debugger is written in C# and can debug both managed
	and unmanaged applications, support for multiple-threaded
	applications and should be relatively easy to port to new
	platforms.

	Details of the release are available in <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011415.html">post</a>. 
	
	The debugger contains both Gtk# and command line interfaces.
	The debugging file format used in Dwarf (its already supported
	by our class libraries and the Mono C# compiler; To debug C
	applications, you need a recent GCC, or to pass the -gdwarf-2
	flag to gcc).

	The debugger is available now, you can get it from <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~martin/debugger/mono-debugger-0.2.0.tar.gz">here</a>
