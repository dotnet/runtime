@item Dec 21st: Mono on PowerPC Progress.

	Paolo reports today that the Mono JIT on the PowerPC was able
	to successfully run the Mono C# compiler to build its first
	programs.  This is by no means complete (exception handling is
	missing, and Boehm GC seems to fail on MacOS X), this shows
	the excellent progress Paolo has been making.

	Zoltan has added support for modules to MCS (generation and
	consumption).

@item Dec 10th: Mono Debugger 0.5 released

	and RPMs are available.  A windows installer was contributed by Johannes Roith.
	
@item Oct 26th: Last Minute Mono BOF

	The first in a series of undercover Mono BOFs at the PDC will take
	place tonight at 7pm on the Academy meeting, in room 411. Come join us
	to plot the evolution.


@item Oct 25th: GTK# 0.11+ Windows Installer available

	Johannes created a <a href="http://java.thn.htu.se/~toor/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-0.11-cvs.exe">Windows Installer for GTK# 0.11+</a> and works
	with Mono 0.28 for Windows.

@item Oct 21st: Mono Community at Novell Forge

	Mono Developers that are looking for a public repository for
	hosting their projects can now use <a
	href="http://forge.novell.com">Novell Forge's</a> which hosts
	a <a
	href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/community/?monocomm">Mono
	Community</a>.

	Novell Forge offers mailing lists, cvs repository, bug
	tracking and mailing list services and all the other services
	you expect.  Mono will continue to be hosted in our own CVS
	repository, and using our <a href="anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS
	servers</a>

@item Oct 13th: SPARC V9, HPPA, Internationalization, GdiPlus

	Dick Porter has checked in our rewrite of the international
	substrate in Mono that uses the <a
	href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/">International
	Components for Unicode</a> library from IBM.  This means that
	we got CultureInfo support through the whole code base now.

	Alexandre Pigolkine has checked-in the new implementation of
	System.Drawing.  We have now dropped the old implementation
	with multiple-backends that we had, and replaced it with an
	implementation that P/Invokes into GDI+.  A GDI+
	implementation on top of <a
	href="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo</a> is used on Unix
	systems.  This step vastly simplifies the development and
	maintenance of System.Drawing. 

	There are plenty of updates to Mono as well, we encourage you
	to read the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/monologue">Monologue</a> to keep
	an eye on recent developments.

	Bernie Solomon just <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-October/002460.html">checked
	in</a> 64-bit support for SPARC v9 and HPPA into the Mono
	runtime.  This also improves the SPARC-32 support.

@item Oct 6th: Linux s390 Mono packages available.

	Neale Ferguson has contributed Mono packages for the
	Linux/s390.  You can get them from the <a
	href="download.html">download</a> page.

@item Oct 5th: Monologue aggregates Mono Blogs

	You can now read an aggregated view of the <a
	href="blogs.html">blogs</a> maintained by Mono developers in
	<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/monologue">Monologue</a>.
	Monologue is available as an HTML page or as an <a
	href="monologue/index.rss">RSS feed</a>.

@item Oct 2nd: Windows packages, MonoDoc 0.7

	Windows packages for Mono 0.28 are now available from our <a
	href="download.html">download</a> page.

	A new version of MonoDoc has been released.  The new version
	is available <a href="archive/monodoc-0.7.tar.gz">here</a>

@item Oct 1st: Mono 0.28 has been released.

	Check out the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.html">Release
	notes</a> for details on Mono 0.28.  This release marks the
	completion of the SourceGear project to add web services
	functionality to Mono and improve its reliability.

@item Sep 30th: Mono Kick Start book available

	The Mono Kick Start book is now <a
	href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672325799/qid=1064937318/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-9624440-8714218?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">available</a>
	in English.  Originally available only in <a

	The book technical review was done by <a
	href="http://www.maurer-it.com/">Dietmar Maurer</a> JIT
	architect at the Mono team.

@item Sep 26th, 2003: DiaCanvas# 0.1 released, Gtk# 0.11 released.

	Mike Kestner has <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2003-September/002475.html">released</a>
	a new version of <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a>.

	Martin has also 
        <a href="http://mwh.sysrq.dk/programs/announcements/diacanvas-sharp-0.1.0.html">released</a>
	his binding to <a href="http://diacanvas.sf.net">DiaCanvas</a> for C#.

@item Sep 16th, 2003: WineLib, Authenticode, Generics, Xslt updates, Wsdl compiler, WSE.

	<b>WineLib:</b> Vladimir has added new libraries to the Wine
	process, which we will soon bring into our packages: the
	various Windows common dialogs can now be used (screenshots:
	<a href="images/colordlg.png">here</a>, <a
	href="images/fontdlg.png">here</a>, <a
	href="images/filedlg.png">here</a> and <a
	href="images/finddlg.png">here</a>.

	Johannes has patches to have Wine track the Gtk theme,
	screenshot <a href="http://www.sport-huettn.de/jroith/swfsample.png">here</a>

	<b>Security:</b> New authenticode support from Sebastien has
	been checked into CVS.

	<b>Xslt:</b> Plenty of conformance updates to the managed
	implementation of Xslt, as well as breaking the libxslt speed
	barrier.  Our managed implementation is now faster than the
	C-based libxslt that we used before.

	<b>Generics:</b> Work continues on generics support, feel free
	to try it out.  The compiler is currently on a separate
	directory until we stability it (gmcs) and you need to compile
	the class libraries with the `generics' profile to try it
	out.  Sample generic programs are included in the CVS module. 

	<b>Wsdl:</b> We now have Wsdl support in Mono: a wsdl compiler
	command line tool, and support on ASP.NET to generate the wsdl
	file from an .asmx file.

	<b>AOT:</b> Many robustness updates to the ahead-of-time
	compiler and a new locking and threading system that avoids
	having "big locks" around the mono kernel, and moves to a
	fine-grained locking system.  The design includes a lattice to
	avoid deadlocks.

	<b>Dogfooding:</b> We are now running Mono's ASP.NET on
	go-mono.com to find problems.  It is currently hosting our
	Monodoc documentation.  The <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html">Apache module
	version</a> and the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com:8080/">XSP
	version</a>.

	<b>WSE:</b> The Web Services Enhancements season has begun.
	The Microsoft.Web.Services namespace and classes are now
	checked into CVS.  

@item Sep 1st, 2003: Ice for Mono;  XmlSerializer generators; Monodoc progress.

	<b>Ice:</b> Vladimir has checked into CVS (Module ginzu) an
	implementation of <a href="http://www.zeroc.com">ZeroC's</a>
	<a href="http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html">ICE</a> protocol.  It
	is implemented using Remoting.  If you were looking for an
	efficient binary protocol to use with Remoting, this is it.

	ICE is simpler to use than CORBA, and was created by people
	who were deeply involved in CORBA and wanted to fix its
	problems (you can see a <a
	href="http://www.zeroc.com/iceVsCorba.html">list of
	differences</a>).

	<b>XmlSerializer</b>: Lluis has checked in a new technology
	for use in our XmlSerializer: the XmlSerializer code
	generator.  Currently our XmlSerializer generates a
	description of instructions for serializing data, these
	instructions are later interpreted while using it: Reflection
	is used to pull all the data.  The code generator is the first
	step into turning the Serializer from an intepreter into a
	compiler and improving the performance of it.

	Currently was used internally to implement the WSDL
	serializer, in the future it will just be part of the standard
	serialization process.

	<b>MonoDoc:</b> New providers!  Thanks to <a
	href="http://www.jaggersoft.com/">Jon Jagger</a> for providing
	us with his master XML files for the C# specification we now
	have integrated the C# spec into Monodoc.  Another provider is
	the Error provider: now we include all the C# compiler errors
	in the help system.

	Alp has contributed various user interface improvement, and
	updated our list widget for key navigation; Ben made the
	matches window more useful and Joshua has helped us clean up
	the ECMA provider even more.

@item Aug 14th, 2003: Mono 0.26 has been released

	A new version of Mono is available, the new features include:
	<a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo support</a>, <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sf.net">Remoting.Corba</a>
	support, as well as a managed XSLT implementation.  

	Existing features have been improved vastly: better
	Windows.Forms, runtime, faster compiler, web services, better
	compliance to the spec and more. 

	Check out the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.26.html">Release
	notes</a> for details.

@item Aug 9th, 2003: Python for .NET Preview 2 available;  Mono Documentation site up.

	Brian Lloyd has <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-August/015313.html">announced</a>
	the availability of his Python binding to .NET.  This works
	with .NET and Mono.  For more information about it, see
	Brian's site at <a href="
	http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/">http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/</a>

	We have uploaded the current Mono Documentation (core
	libraries and Gtk#) to <a
	href="http://mono.ximian.com:8080"/>http://mono.ximian.com:8080</a>.
	The site is running the ASP.NET edition of <a
	href="archive/monodoc-0.6.tar.gz">MonoDoc 0.6</a> on XSP.

@item Aug 6th, 2003: Winforms samples

	Timothy Parez is coordinating the effort to create sample
	programs that exercise the various Windows.Forms controls.  We
	are using this as graphical regression test suite for the Mono
	implementation.

	The screenshots of the various widgets, together with the
	source code is available on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">WineSamples</a>
	page on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/">Mono Wiki</a>.

	A new cvs module called `winforms' has been created that
	contains the source code for the samples.  To run the samples,
	you can install the WineLib packages available from our <a
	href="download.html">download page</a>.

@item Aug 5th, 2003: New Apache Module architecture: 1.3 and 2.x supported

	Gonzalo rearchitected our Apache module for hosting Mono and
	ASP.NET.  The previous incarnation hosted a Mono runtime on
	each Apache process, which lead to a slow setup for webforms.
	The new setup uses a shared mono process for all the incoming
	requests.  Daniel later improved up the new architecture and
	added dual support, so now in addition to Apache 2.x, we
	support Apache 1.3 with the same codebase.

	The new code is available on CVS, on module `mod_mono', and
	now requires an XSP installation to be available. 

@item Aug 4th, 2003: Ximian acquired by Novell.

	Today <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> acquired <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>.  The press release is
	available <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com./about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=novell">here</a>.

	Mono and Gnome form an integral part of the Novell strategy.

@item Jul 30th, 2003: Remoting.CORBA, Managed XSLT.

	Today Lluis announced that Mono CVS contains all the fixes to
	run <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">Remoting.CORBA</a>:
	both client and server channels work; We are interested in people
	testing it with other ORBs.

	Ben checked-in today his managed implementation of Xslt that
	we mentioned on Jul 19th; This uncovered various limitations
	on the XPath implementation, which Piers has swifly removed.
	Monodoc, NUnit and our Corcompare work with it.  Since this is
	implementation is not completed yet, we still support the
	libxslt-based version by default.  For more details on how to
	try the new XSLT implementation, see <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001681.html">Ben's
	post</a>

@item Jul 27th, 2003: Wine packages and Daily Snapshots 

	MonoWine packages (used to run System.Windows.Forms) software
	are now available from our (<a
	href="download.html">download</a> page).  You can track the
	progress on our <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">Wiki
	page.</a>

	We're now building daily snapshots of Mono.  They come in
	three distinct flavors:

	<ul>
		* mono snapshot tarballs - These are 'release-style' tarballs and
		  contain everything necessary to setup a new
		  installation from scratch.  This includes the Mono
	 	  runtime and all the assemblies we distribute.

		* monocharge tarballs - These tarballs contain only
		  the assemblies built on that day.

		* monolite tarballs - These tarballs contain a copy of
		  'corlib.dll', 'mcs.exe', 'System.dll', 'System.Xml.dll' and
		  'Mono.CSharp.Debugger.dll'. They can be used to
		  re-bootstrap an out-of-sync installation.
	</ul>

	The daily builds are availble here: <a href="http://go-mono.com/daily">http://go-mono.com/daily</a>

	If you find that the builds are broken, please notify Duncan.

@item Jul 19th, 2003: Recent developments

	Since Mono has matured, we have limited the news on the site
	to major accomplishments that are finished, but this week, it
	is worth devoting some time to talk about some of the
	work-in-progress projects that are progressing.

	Jackson has added support to the IL assembler for generics as
	well as to the PEAPI library, and it has assembled its first
	generic program.  Support for handling images with generics
	has been on our file format reader for a while, but the JIT
	engine is still incomplete. 

	On the XSLT world, Atsushi and Ben continue to make big
	improvements.  Ben recently got the prototype managed XSLT
	implementation to run its first stylesheet.  Although
	currently Mono uses libxslt to implement the System.Xml.Xsl
	namespace, to have a fully .NET compliant implementation we
	will need a managed version, and this is the beginning of it.

	Lluis recently posted an update on the <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001550.html">state
	of WSDL</a> in Mono.  Now that the web services runtime is
	ready, the WSDL compiler becomes more important as a
	development tool.

	Atsushi continues his work on the DTD validating reader in
	System.Xml, as well as improving our XML Schema support.

@item Jul 14th, 2003: New build system;  IPV6 support.

	Peter Williams has contributed a new build system that
	addresses many of the annoyance we had with our previous build
	system.  He has worked on this for a few weeks, and Gonzalo
