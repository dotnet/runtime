	<a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a> announced the
	launch of the Mono project, an effort to create an Open Source
	implementation of the .NET Development Framework.  

	Mono includes: <a href="c-sharp.html">a compiler</a> for the
	C# language, a <a href="runtime.html">runtime</a> for the
	Common Language Infrastructure and a set of <a
	href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>

** Nov 16, 2001

	Mike Kestner has posted an <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2001-November/000015.html">update</a>
	on Gtk# development.

** Nov 14, 2001

	Paolo today got the Mono C# compiler running <a
	href="http://mail.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2001-November/001941.html">on
	Linux</a>.  It compiles a sample program and then the sample
	program is executed.

	Mutator unary operators (++ and --) in the compiler are fully
	functional, they used to only work on variables, and now they
	are complete.

	To sum things up: The Mono C# compiler is written in C# and
	uses the .NET classes to get its work done.  To make this work
	on Linux work has to happen in various fronts:
<ul>
		* The C# compiler is being worked on and can compile
		  many programs now (our test suite at this point is 
		  made up of 40 tests).

		* The class libraries need to be mature enough to support
		  the compiler, particularly System.Reflection.Emit (which is 
		  what Paolo has been working on lately). 

	  	  The compiler currently requires 103 classes from the
		  .NET runtime (you can get the list by running: <b>monodis --typeref mcs.exe</b>

		* The interpreter should be mature enough to run the actual
		  compiler byte codes and the corlib bytecodes.
</ul>

	At the same time, Dietmar is working on the JIT engine which will
	replace our interpreter in production.

** Nov 12, 2001

	Dietmar got value types working on the JIT engine.  Sean has
	got assembly loading in the runtime (required for NUnit).

	More progress on enumerations and attributes from Ravi.

	Nick keeps working on improving our class libraries. 

** Nov 8, 2001

	Enumerations, array access and attributes for the C# compiler are into the CVS now.

	Full array support is not complete, but moving along.

** Nov 5, 2001

	Dietmar's new set of patches to the JIT have 20 out of 33
	tests running now.

** Nov 4, 2001

	Mike Kestner, main Gtk# contributor has posted a very interesting <a
	href="http://mail.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2001-November/000013.html">
	update</a> on his work on Gtk#.  

	Ravi commited the initial support for Attributes in the
	compiler. 

	Many HTML Controls from Leen checked into CVS.

	Paolo checked in his new System.Reflection and
	System.Reflection.Emit implementations.  He has been working
	steadily on this huge task for a few weeks now.  This is the
	foundation for the Mono C# compiler, and hence a very
	important piece of the puzzle.

** Nov 3, 2001

	Many clean ups have been going into the class library by Nick Drochak. 

	Mega patch from Dietmar: he commited the flow analysis code
	for the JITer. 

	A lot of work has been going into the WebControls by Gaurav (4
	new controls plus improved and bug fixed base classes).

** Nov 1, 2001

	Ravi commited the caller-side method selection of methods with
	variable length arguments.  Now he depends on Miguel finishing
	the array handling support. 

** Oct 27, 2001

	Lots of classes for System.Web from Gaurav were commited this
	morning.

	Some large recent developments:

	The Decimal implementation from Martin Weindel has been
	partially integrated (we need to put the internalcalls in
	place now and compile and link the decimal code).

	Derek Holden commited recently the IntegerFormatter code into
	the CVS, so we got a pretty comprehensive integer formatting
	engine that we can finally use all over the place. 

	Compiler got support for lock as well as assorted bug fixes.
	Ravi is still working on array support (and then we can
	optimize foreach for the array case).   

	Dietmar is busy working on flow analysis on the JITer, the
	previous mechanism of generating the forest was wrong.  Paolo
	has been a busy bee reworking the System.Reflection.Emit
	support code, and we should have some pretty nice stuff next
	week.  Dick on the other hand is still working on the
	WaitOne/WaitAll emulation code.  WaitAll is like select on
	steroids: it can wait for different kinds of objects: files,
	mutexes, events and a couple of others.

	Mike Kestner is busy working on Gtk# which is now using the
	.defs files to quickly wrap the API.

** Oct 18, 2001

	Reworking expressions to support cleanly indexers and
	properties.  <a href="http://www.nat.org/evolution.php3">11
	days</a> until Evolution 1.0 ships.  

	Ximian users around the world <!--a
	href="http://www.bez.it/IMAGES/nora.jpg"-->rejoice<!--/a--> with
	recent C# compiler progress.

** Oct 17, 2001

	Delegate support has been checked into the compiler
	(definition and invocation); break/continue implemented.

** Oct 15, 2001

	JIT engine supports many of the object constructs now (object
	creation, vtable setup, interface table setup).  

	The C# compiler now has almost full property support (only
	missing bit are pre-post increment/decrement operations),
	delegates are now created (still missing delegate invocation).
	try/catch/finally is also supported in the compiler now.

	System.Decimal implementation is in, as well as many crypto
	classes.

** Oct 5, 2001

	Sergey has released his first version of the <b>ilasm</b>
	assembler written in C#.  You can get it from his web page:
	<a
	href="http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua">http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua</a>.

	The plan is to integrate ildasm into the Mono CVS soon.  This
	component should in theory also be reusable for SharpDevelop
	eventually.

** Oct 4, 2001

	Our System.Reflection.Emit implementation created its first
	executable today.  This means that a very simple .NET program
	that was compiled on Windows was able to generate a .NET program
	while running on Linux using the Mono runtime.

	The various piece of the puzzle are starting to get together:
	the compiler can compile simple programs now and we are
	basically focusing on completeness now.  

** Sep 28, 2001

	<a
	href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/default.asp">Sharp
	Develop 0.80</a> was released today.

** Sep 26, 2001

	More progress: more opcodes are working (Paolo); The compiler
	runs up to a point in Mint (Paolo); operator overloading works
	(both unary and binary) all over the place (Miguel); Completed decimal
	type conversions (Miguel); New build system in place based on
	Ant (Sean and Sergey);  Refactored and documented the
	internals of the JIT engine (Dietmar);  StatementExpressions
	handled correctly (Miguel).

** Sep 21, 2001

	A couple of news-worthy items: Dick got the initial thread
	support into mint; Paolo implemented many new opcodes; Dietmar
	got long operations and mul/div working on the JITer; Ravi rewrote
	the Method selector for expressions to be conformant; Miguel
	got i++ working.   All in tonight's snapshot

** Sep 19, 2001

	Paolo has written a section on <a href="porting.html">Porting
	Mono</a> to othre architectures.

** Sep 18, 2001

	<A a href="download.html#sep-18">Mono 0.7</a> has been
	released (runtime engine, class libraries
	and C# compiler).  Check the <a href="archive/mono-0.7">Mono
	0.7 announcement</a> for details

** Sep 17, 2001

	Mike Kestner's Gtk# (Gtk-sharp) was checked into the CVS
	repository.  Gtk# can run a simple hello world application.
	The binding is nice, as it maps Gtk+ signals to delegates in
	C#.  You can see the Gtk# Hello World program <a href="src/HelloWorld.cs">here</a>

	Gtk-sharp should be available on the next snapshot set.

** Sep 10, 2001

	Dietmar checked in his CIL tree/forest regeneration and most
	importantly, the x86 instruction selector burg grammar.


** Sep 5, 2001

	The MCS compiler <b>can compile the sample Hello World</b>
	application and generate a Windows/CIL executable that runs!

	This executable runs with the Mono Interpreter of course (see
	August 28)

** Sep 4, 2001

	Dietmar checked into CVS the `monoburg' architecture
	independent instruction selector for the JIT engine.

** Aug 28, 2001

	<b>.NET Hello World is working under Mono!</b>  The latest snapshots
	will let you run it.   

	Hello World consits of 1821 CIL instructions, 
        performs 66 subroutine calls and loads 12 classes from the corlib.dll

	Good work Mono team!
