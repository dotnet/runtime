	Martin Baulig fixed the remaining bugs that prevented MCS to
	compile our corlib.  The compilation was tricky because of the way
	MCS bootstraps the compile (internally mcs uses the types that are
	being defined at that point to perform compares).

	Martin and Paolo have been working hard on fixing the
	remaining issues.  Currently 102 test pass and 15 fail with
	our resulting corlib.

	Jesus' SoapFormatter classes are now in CVS.

	I have been redoing the type lookup system for MCS.  The
	interesting bit is that I did most of this work on an airplane
	using MCS itself.  Which is a good test that the compiler is 
	now a good development tool.

	Duncan, Mike and Rachel have been hard at work with Gtk#, now
	there are bindings for the GtkHTML widget (the one used by
	Evolution's composer).  And Rachel also got the beginning of GNOME
	bindings, that should simplify application development.

	A big thanks goes to Dennis Hayes for getting the
	Windows.Forms work together, and commiting so many stubs for Windows.Forms. 

@item Jun 24, 2002

	Ajay has been very busy improving and extending the
	XmlSerialization code.  All fields had to be re-ordered to
	match the Microsoft implementation.

@item Apr 20, 2002

	Some updates from the hacking lines:

	<b>The web:</b> Patrik Torstensson last week contributed the
	http runtime support and started work on thread pools.  This
	is part of the ASP.NET support.

	<b>Docs:</b> John Barnette, John Sohn and Adam Treat have been
	hacking on MonoDoc.

	<b>ADO.NET:</b> Daniel Morgan and Rodrigo Moya have been
	working on the <a href="ado-net">ADO.NET</a> support, and got
	the first signs of life this week (we can connect, insert
	rows; do transactions: commit/rollback; SQL errors and
	exceptions work).  Check <a
	href="mailing-lists.html">mono-patches</a> for all the
	goodies.

	<b>Optimizations:</b> A number of optimizations in the runtime
	made the compiler twice as fast this week:

	Early this week Patrik started the string
	rewrite in the runtime.  Today Dietmar finished the
	constructors and deployed the new layout. 

	Paolo got the JIT engine to generate profiles, which were in
	turn used to find hot spots in Reflection, which he improved.

	Daniel Lewis (of Regex fame) noticed the performance issues
	with our current array layout, and contributed a new array
	representation.

	At the same time Dietmar started the the JIT inline code and
	implemented constant propagation.  These two optimizations
	together are very powerful.

	<b>Bug fixing:</b> And of course everyone has been helping out
	with the bug fixing (Duncan, Gonzalo, Jonathan, Miguel, Nick,
	Ravi, Sergey)


@item Apr 18, 2002

	Dietmar's inlining for the JIT engine just landed into
	CVS. This is only a first cut and more improvements will come later.

	Patrik, Paolo, Dietmar and Gonzalo have been busy optimizing
	our class libraries and runtime engine to become faster. Many changes
	on CVS as well.

@item Apr 11, 2002

	Gtk# 0.1 "ButtonHook" has been <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2002-April/000048.html">released</a>

	people porting the Mono Runtime to new platforms.

@item Apr 6, 2002

	<a href="http://www.dotnetremoting.cc/book/AdvancedDotNetRemoting.asp">
	Advanced .NET Remoting</a> from Ingo Rammer is now available. Ingo

	resource for anyone interested in remoting.

@item Apr 5, 2002

	Transparent proxy support has been finished, congrats to
	Dietmar.  Our JIT engine on CVS contains the implementation.
	This should enable people to test the remoting framework on
	Mono.

        Debugging information is now generated by the compiler thanks
        to Martin's work.  The resulting dwarf file can be used to

@item Mar 19, 2002

	Martin has been working on our debugging infrastructure, both
	on the JIT side of things (adding dward support) as well as on
	the class libraries (so that MCS can start generating
	debugging information).
	
	Jason and Kral keep working on the System.Xml namespace,
	allowing Mike to move more to self-hosting his Gtk# code.  

	The System.Web classes are now part of the build (and they are
	also part of the class status now).  Ajay contributed a large
	chunk of code to the System.Xml.Schema namespace

	Dan (of regex fame) has been working on internal calls
	support: moving more code from the old monowrapper to become
	internal calls.

	Paolo and Dietmar are working steadily on our runtime
	environment, fixing bugs, adding missing features and allowing
	us to run the compiler on Linux.

	Remember to post your bug reports.

	The nice class status on the right is brought to you by
	endless hacking hours from Piers and Nick.  These status
	report pages have been helping us track down various mistakes
	in our classes (very useful, check it out for yourself)

@item Mar 12, 2002

        At midnight, in Italy, Paolo got the Mono C# compiler to self
        host on Linux, the last bug has been squashed to self
        hostingness.  We have now a fully self hosting compiler in Linux.

        A release will follow up shortly.

	compiler compiling itself on Linux</a>
	completely for the first time!  The resulting image still contains
	some errors, but the whole compiler process goes now.  Later in the day
	and a couple of small optimizations and bug fixes, the compile
	speed was improved in 400%

	We are very close to have a complete self hosting environment now.

	Internet Server') that is mostly used to test our IO layer, a
	<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/dick-mis-server.png">screenshot</a>

	Paolo and Dietmar are busy making our runtime self sufficient on 
	non-Windows platforms.  

	C# compiler front:  A lot of focus in the past weeks after
	the C# became self hosting has been in making the compiler a useful
	tool for development: improve error handling, provide better error
	reports, fixing all known bugs, and finally profiling of the compiler
	has begun.

@item Jan 8, 2002

	Our compiler has been self-supporting since January 3rd.  In
	the meantime, we have been busy working on making it run on
	Linux.  Today Paolo got more work done on Reflection.Emit and
	the compiler compiled `console.cs' (a sample Mono program) on
	Linux.

@item Jan 4, 2002

	Dietmar landed the Unicode support patch.  Class libraries and
	runtimes are now fully Unicode aware.  The details are <a href=
	"http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-January/002409.html">

	Last minute breaking news: Paolo got our compiler in Linux to
	compile fib.cs, patches are comming tomorrow once we have
	ChangeLog entries.

	Gtk# will be our foundation on which we will be implementing
	System.Windows.Forms.  

@item Jan 3, 2002

	Mono C# compiler becomes self-sufficient.  We can now continue
	development of the compiler with itself.  

	Work on the class libraries is still underway for having a full
	self hosting system.  We hope to achieve our goal of self-hosting
	on Linux before the end of the month.

	After a lot of work, the C# compiler can compile itself.
	There are still errors in the generated image, but they are
	being fixed quickly.

	We will soon have the first non-Microsoft C# implementation!

@item Dec 18, 2001

	JIT: More work on our IO abstraction layer (Dick). 

	JIT: exception handling for unmanaged code (Dietmar)

	System.Reflection: Support for PropertyInfo and
	PropertyBuilder as well as the various queries for MethodBase.

	C#: Pre-processor; Rewrite of MemberLookup which fixed many of
	the outstanding issues.  More bug fixing allows it to compile
	more programs.

@item Dec 14, 2001

	Dietmar has improved the register allocation and now Mono performs
	two to three times as fast as it did yesterday.  Amazing.

	The compiler keeps moving along, explicit interface
	implementation is there.

@item Dec 11, 2001

	The JIT engine can now run all the compiler regression tests as 
	well as assorted other programs, many more opcodes added
	recently.  Currently the JIT engine uses a very simplistic register
	allocator (just enough to allow us to focus on feature completeness)
	and that will be the next major task to improve performance and
	reduce spills and reloads. 

	On the C# compiler front: language features are now pretty
	much complete.  The big missing tasks are unsafe code support,
	visibility, explicit interface implementation plus static flow
	analysis.  There are many small bugs that need to be addressed.

	You can get your copy of the <a href="snapshots">latest Mono</a>

	More work is also required on fixing the foundation class
	libraries, it is easy to find spots now since Nick got the
	`make test' going.

@item Dec 1, 2001

	AnonCVS access to Mono is here (updated every hour).  Thanks
	to <a href="http://www.hispalinux.es">HispaLinux</a> and Jesus
	Climent for helping to set this up.

@item Nov 30, 2001

	All tests from the mono runtime work with the JIT engine now
	(Dietmar).

	Recursive enumeration definition in the C# compiler are
	working now (Ravi).

	More work on the Web classes (Gaurav).

@item Nov 28, 2001

	JIT land: Paolo got GDB support into the JIT engine while
	Dietmar added exceptions support to it.

	The C# compiler supports all array initializations now, and the
	switch statement as well as fixing many existing bugs.  Many
	new more tests.
	
	Nick keeps working on improving our class library test suite.

	Dick has almost completed the Mono IO layer.

<blockquote>
	Paolo today got the Mono C# compiler running <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2001-November/001941.html">on
	Linux</a>.  It compiles a sample program and then the sample
	program is executed.

	Mutator unary operators (++ and --) in the compiler are fully
	functional, they used to only work on variables, and now they
	are complete.

	To sum things up: The Mono C# compiler is written in C# and
	uses the .NET classes to get its work done.  To make this work
	on Linux work has to happen in various fronts:
<ul>
		* The C# compiler is being worked on and can compile
		  many programs now (our test suite at this point is 
		  made up of 40 tests).

		* The class libraries need to be mature enough to support
		  the compiler, particularly System.Reflection.Emit (which is 
		  what Paolo has been working on lately). 

	  	  The compiler currently requires 103 classes from the
		  .NET runtime (you can get the list by running: <b>monodis --typeref mcs.exe</b>

		* The interpreter should be mature enough to run the actual
		  compiler byte codes and the corlib bytecodes.
</ul>

	At the same time, Dietmar is working on the JIT engine which will
	replace our interpreter in production.

	Some large recent developments:

	The Decimal implementation from Martin Weindel has been

	place now and compile and link the decimal code).

	Derek Holden commited recently the IntegerFormatter code into
	the CVS, so we got a pretty comprehensive integer formatting
	engine that we can finally use all over the place. 

	Compiler got support for lock as well as assorted bug fixes.
	Ravi is still working on array support (and then we can
	optimize foreach for the array case).   

	Dietmar is busy working on flow analysis on the JITer, the
	previous mechanism of generating the forest was wrong.  Paolo
	has been a busy bee reworking the System.Reflection.Emit
	support code, and we should have some pretty nice stuff next
	week.  Dick on the other hand is still working on the
	WaitOne/WaitAll emulation code.  WaitAll is like select on
	steroids: it can wait for different kinds of objects: files,
