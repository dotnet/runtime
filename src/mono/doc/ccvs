* CVS Access

	If you are an active Mono developer, you can get a CVS account
	that hosts the Mono source code.  

	If you are not a developer, but want to track the development, please
	see the <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> instructions.

	Send an e-mail to miguel with your public OpenSSH key for this
	purpose.  Please specify if the key was generated with SSH version 1
	or version 2.

	If you are using SSH version 2, please generate your key using:

<pre>
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>

	And mail me the id_rsa.pub file.

	If you are using SSH version 1, run:
<pre>
	ssh-keygen
</pre>

	And mail me your identity.pub file.

	If you are using SSH from SSH Communications Security (they offer
	a free SSH client for personal use), you have to use OpenSSH to
	convert your public key to the required format. You have to use 
	OpenSSH's ssh-keygen program and write the following:

<pre>
	ssh-keygen -i -f id_XXX.pub > my_public_key.pub
</pre>
	
	where the file <pre>id_XXX.pub</pre> is your public key file, 
	normally located under <pre>~/.ssh/</pre> or <pre>~/.ssh2/</pre>.
	Send to miguel the <pre>my_public_key.pub</pre> file. 

	The *exact* format for this file must be:

<pre>
	ssh-rsa XXXXX....
</pre>

	You will need CVS and SSH.  Windows users can get both by
	installing Cygwin (<a
	href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>)

	Unix users will probably have those tools installed already.

** Checking out the sources

	To check out the sources for the first time from the
	repository, use this command:

<pre>
	export CVS_RSH=ssh
	export CVSROOT=username@mono-cvs.ximian.com:/cvs/public
	cvs -z3 co mcs mono
</pre>

** Updating your sources

	Every day people will be making changes, to get your latest
	updated sources, use:

<pre>
	cvs -z3 update -Pd mcs mono
</pre>

	Note: The '-z3' enables compression for the whole cvs action.
	The '-Pd' makes the update operation (P)rune directories that
	have been deleted and get new (d)irectories added to the
	repository.

** Making patches

	Usually you will want to make a patch to contribute, and let
	other people review it before commiting it.  To obtain such a
	"patch", you type:
	
<pre>
	cd directory-you-want-to-diff
	cvs -z3 diff -u > file.diff
	mail mono-list@ximian.com < file.diff
</pre>

** Keeping track of changes.

	We provide two e-mail based mechanisms to keep track of
	changes to the code base:
	
	<ul>
		* <a href="mailto:mono-patches-request@ximian.com">
		  mono-patches@ximian.com</a>: This mailing list receives
		  in patch form all the changes that are being made to the
		  CVS.

		* <a href="mailto:mono-cvs-list-request@ximian.com">
		  mono-cvs-list@ximian.com</a>: This mailing list only
		  receives the CVS commit logs with a list of files
		  modified.
	</ul>

	We hope to offer LXR and Bonsai in the future as well.

** Commiting your work

	Once you get approval to commit to the CVS, or if you are
	commiting code that you are the maintainer of, you will want
	to commit your code to CVS. 

	To do this, you have to "add" any new files that you created:

<pre>
	cvs add new-file.cs
</pre>

	And then commit your changes to the repository:

<pre>
	cvs commit file-1.cs file-2.cs
</pre>

** The Mailing List

	To keep track of the various development and changes to the
	CVS tree, you can subscribe to the mono-cvs-list@ximian.com.
	To subscribe, send an email message to
	mono-cvs-list-request@ximian.com and in the body of the
	message put `subscribe'.

	This will send you an email message every time a change is
	made to the CVS repository, together with the information that
	the author of the changes submitted.
	
** Recommendations

	Please do not commit code that would break the compile to the
	CVS, because that normally wastes everybody's time.  Two things 
	are important in this step: trying to build your sources and making 
	sure that you add all the new files before you do a commit.

	To build the sources, most of the type trying the `make' command
	is enough.  In some cases (the class libraries) we use nant, so
	you need to run nant manually.

	Use ChangeLog entries so we can keep textual descriptions of
	your work, and use the contents of your ChangeLog file as the
	CVS commit message (ie, paste the contents of this into the
	editor buffer).

	If you are making changes to someone else's code, please make
	sure you get in touch with the maintainer of that code before
	applying patches.  You want to avoid commiting conflicting
	work to someone else's code.
