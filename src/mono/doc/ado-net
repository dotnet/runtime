* ADO.NET

	The coordinator for the ADO.NET implementation is 
	<a href="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">Rodrigo Moya</a>, 
	with the collaboration of: 
	<a href="mailto:danmorg@sc.rr.com">Daniel Morgan</a>, 
	<a href="mailto:tim@timcoleman.com">Tim Coleman</a>,

	<a href="mailto:vladimir@pobox.com">Vladimir Vukicevic</a>.
	

* Action plan

	The current plan to implement ADO.NET is as follows:

	<b>Step 1:</b> Initial <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdatasqlclient.asp?frame=true">System.Data.SqlClient</a> Provider:

	<ul>
		* Initial implementation of System.Data.SqlClient is based on
		  the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/idocs/">PostgreSQL C API</a> which is a
		  client API to the PostgreSQL DBMS.  PostgreSQL was chosen so we could quickly
		  create and test the System.Data classes.
		  
		* Once the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdatasqlclient.asp?frame=true">System.Data.SqlClient</a>
		  code is functional and is usable by other people, we willl move it to
		  Mono.Data.PostgreSQL.  
		  
		* <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/postgresql.html">Current PostgreSQL ADO.NET Provider Status and Test Notes</a>

	</ul>

	<b>Step 2:</b> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataOleDb.asp?frame=true">System.Data.OleDb</a> Provider:
		
	<ul>
		* <p>On Unix systems: System.Data.OleDb uses the
		<a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">LibGDA</a>
		 engine. 

		  <p>LibGDA is a data access engine like ADO/OLE-DB, but for Unix.  The 
		  GDA in libGDA stands for GNU/GNOME Data Access, but it does not require GNOME.
		  It only requires glib2 and libxml2.  LibGDA is used by 
		  libgnomedb, GNOME-DB, and gaSQL.
		  
		  <p>There is work under way to get libgda working under 
		  Windows using Cygwin by the GNOME-DB developers.
		  
		  <p>LibGDA has providers for 
		  <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, 
		  <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, 
		  XML, 
		  ODBC (via <a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a>),
		  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>, 
		  <a href="http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_interbase.html">Interbase</a>, 
		  <a href="http://www.sybase.com/downloads">Sybase</a> and 
		  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp">Microsoft SQL Server</a> (
		  via <a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a>), 
		  <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">IBM DB2 Universal Database</a>,
		  <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/download.html">SQL Lite</a>,
		  and http://www.microsoft.com/office/access/default.asp">MS Access</a> 
		  (via <a href="http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/">MDB Tools</a>).

		* On Windows systems: System.Data.OleDb will use libgda as well,
		  if we can get it working, or OLE-DB as
		  its engine.
		  
	</ul>

	<b>Step 3:</b> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdatasqlclient.asp?frame=true">System.Data.SqlClient</a> Provider:

	<ul>
		* <p>System.Data.SqlClient will then become a
		  provider for Microsoft SQL Server, both on Windows and
		  Linux, to be compatible with applications written
		  for the Microsoft .NET Development Framework.
		  
		  <p>Once Step 1 has been completed and the PostgreSQL
		  provider support has been moved to its own place at 
		  Mono.Data.PostgreSQL, we will use 
		  <a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a> as the basis
		  for providing access to Microsoft SQL Server databases.  Or we will
		  use FreeTDS and jTDS (a 100% Java JDBC Provider for TDS) as a basis for
		  creating a pure managed SQL Server provider.
		  
		  <P>FreeTDS is a C API for Unix and Windows that implements 
		  the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used in accessing 
		  Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases.  A .NET Data Provider could be
		  created for Sybase databases as well, but this would be put in Mono.Data.Sybase.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 4:</b> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/MSDN-FILES/027/001/668/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true">System.Data.Odbc</a> Provider:
	
	<ul>
		* An ADO.NET Provider for ODBC has been created in
		  System.Data.Odbc for those using ODBC.
		  On Unix, <a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a> mabye used
		  which has libodbc.so
		  On Windows, uses the native ODBC libraries (odbc32.dll) that comes 
		  with Windows since unixODBC is supposed to be compatible with that.
		  If you do not have odbc32.dll on Wwindows, get the latest MDAC 
		  from Microsoft.  The mapping between these native shared libraries is handled 
		  in etc/mono/config
		  In mono cvs, the file is mono/data/config.in
		  		  
		  <p>unixODBC works on Unix and Windows.  Well, I have not actually 
		  used it on Cygwin, but it does build and install without problems.  
		  
		  <p>unixODBC has providers for:
		  Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase (via FreeTDS), 
		  MySQL, PostgreSQL, Informix, IBM DB2 Universal Database, 
		  Interbase, miniSQL (mSQL), AdabasD, Empress, Ingres, Sap DB, and others.
		  
	</ul>

	<b>Step 5:</b> Other ADO.NET providers:

	<ul>
		* <p>The idea in Microsoft .NET System.Data is to have
		  a managed provider for each supported DBMS.  System.Data.SqlClient
		  for Microsoft SQL Server.  
		  System.Data.OracleClient for Oracle 8i and 9i.

          <p>Two Mono.Data providers have been started: 
          Mono.Data.MySql for the MySQL client/server database
          and Mono.Data.SqliteClient for the SQL Lite database.
          See Current Status for more information on these providers.
          
		  <p>Some providers we would like to have are
		  Mono.Data.DB2, Mono.Data.miniSQL,  
		  System.Data.OracleClient, Mono.Data.Interbase,
		  Mono.Data.Berkeley, and SapDB.
		  Others, of course, are welcomed.
		  		  
		  <p>System.Data has been designed so 
		  non-database providers can be created too.
	</ul>

	<b>Step 6:</b> Create tools for ADO.NET

	<ul>
		* <p><b>SQL# CLI - a command-line tool</b> to execute SQL commands,
		  test connection strings, and connect to various ADO.NET
		  providers in Mono.  The SQL# CLI has been started on and can be found in 
		  mcs/class/System.Data/Test/SqlSharpCli.cs
		  It is written in C# and runs on Mono.

		* <p><b>SQL# GUI - a GUI tool</b> to execute SQL commands.  This
		  has not been started.  The idea is to use the GnomeDbSqlEditor,
		  GnomeDbBrowser, and GnomeDbGrid gtk+ widgets that exists 
		  in libgnomedb# that is part of gtk#.  However, we could base it
		  on System.Windows.Forms, but System.Windows.Forms in Mono 
		  is not as complete as gtk#.  
		
          <p>libgnomedb uses libgda for its data model and data access capabilities and
          can be found <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">here</a>.  libgnomedb#
          and gda# are part of <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">gtk#</a>
          libgnomedb# is the C# bindings to libgnomedb which is a gtk+ GUI 
          widget library for data access.       
          gda# is the C# bindings to libgda which is a generic data access
          library that has providers for many databases.
          
		* <p>ADO.NET Configuration command-line and GUI tools.  These tools have
		  not been started.  They could become a part of SQL# though.  The
		  configuration tool can be used to set up DSNs for the ODBC and OLE-DB
		  providers.  The tools would be written in C# and run on Mono.
		
	</ul>
	
* Current Status

	<p>We are working on Steps 1, 2, 4, and 5. We still have tons and tons of 
	stuff still to do.  If you have any ideas, let us know on the mono-list@ximian.com
	
	<p><b>For Step 1</b>, the <p>PostgreSQL</p> provider can connect, 
	execute commands, retrieve data via a Data Reader, read data in a DataTable 
	in a DataSet via a Data Adapter, get a DataTable holding schema data,
	and use input parameters in its SQL.  Currently, the PostgreSQL provider
	exists in System.Data.SqlClient.  It needs to be moved 
	to Mono.Data.PostgreSQL so the Microsoft SQL Server provider can
	be placed in System.Data.SqlClient.
		
	<p><b>For Step 2</b>, Rodrigo Moya has been working on <b>System.Data.OleDb</b>
	which uses libgda
	which is an OLE-DB/ADO data access for Unix.  The C-Sharp bindings to libgda
	currently work - meaning they can compile, run, and you can connect to a
	PostgreSQL database via libgda via the C-Sharp bindings to libgda.  Basic
	functionality (execution of commands, data retrieval, transactions, etc) are
	now working. Current focus is on filling up the missing pieces (Data adapters
	mainly) and schema support.  We need help building libgda on Windows though.  libgda
	builds find on linux though.
	
	<p><b>For Step 3</b>, we need someone to start on the <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> 
	and <b>Sybase</b> support.  This can be done by creating 
	a <b>FreeTDS</b> .NET Data Provider 
	or C# bindings to FreeTDS native libraries.  A better solution, but a solution 
	that would take longer, would be to create a pure
	managed provider in C# that implements the TDS (Tabular DataStream) protocol.  TDS
	is used to access Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases.  Another possibility
	is to wrap System.Data.SqlClient around System.Data.OleDb since System.Data.OleDb on 
	Mono uses <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">libgda</a> and libgda has 
	a FreeTDS provider.  Yet another possibility, port 
	the <a href="http://jtds.sourceforge.net/">jTDS</a> provider to a pure C# ADO.NET 
	provider.  jTDS is a 100% pure Java (Type 4) open source JDBC 2.0 driver for 
	the Microsoft SQL Server series (6.5, 7.x and 2000). 
	
	<p><b>For Step 4</b>, Brian Ritchie has contributed an initial implementation of
	an <b>ODBC</b> ADO.NET Provider that uses unixODBC on Linux and the native odbc
	that comes on Windows.  There is basic implementations of 
    OdbcConnection, OdbcCommand, OdbcDataReader, OdbcParameter, and 
    OdbcParameterCollection.  The provider can execute queries and display result sets 
    (and ExecuteNonQuery too).  Currently, developers are working on the Parameter & 
    Transaction support.  It was tested on Debian against a DB2 7.2 UDB.  It was
    also test on Windows XP against a Microsoft SQL Server 2000.
	
	<p><b>For Step 5</b>, we have create two Mono.Data providers so far: 
	Mono.Data.MySql and Mono.Data.SqliteClient.
	
	<p><b>Mono.Data.MySql</b> is an ADO.NET provider for 
	the <b>MySQL</b> client/server database management system
	that uses the MySQL C Client Library.  This provider is 
	found in Mono.Data.MySql.  Currently, we can connect, 
	execute simple commands, and
	retrieve results using a data reader.  A schema DataTable has been partially 
	implemented which is returned from GetSchemaTable() in MySqlDataReader.
	The shared client libraries 
	between windows version and linux are different: windows has libmySQL.dll 
	while linux has libmysqlclient.so.  This is handled by the 
	file etc/mono/config which is mapped by the mono runtime in knowing
	which native shared library to load.  In cvs, this file is mono/config.in and
	can be modified with a text editor.  
	The C# Bindings to MySQL are thanks to Brad Meril.

	<p><b>Mono.Data.SqliteClient</b> is an ADO.NET provider for
	the <b>SQL Lite</b> database.  SQL Lite can be 
	found <a href"http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/download.html">here</a>.
	There is SQL Lite binaries for Linux and Windows.  sqlite.dll on Windows 
	and sqlite.so on Linux.	The SQL Lite proivder
	was contributed by Vladimir Vukicevic.
		
	<p><b>DataSet, DataAdaptor, DataTable, DataRelation, DataRow, DataColumn,
	DataColumnCollection, DataRowCollection, and others</b> need more work.
		
	<p><b>Integration with ASP.NET</b> needs to be started, such as, data binding
	to a System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid.  This may involve implementing many classes
	in System.Web and System.Data.  Gonzalo, Gaurav, Leen, Patrik, Duncan, and others are 
	working very hard on the ASP.NET support. If you want to help, 
	contact <a href="mailto:gonzalo@ximian.com">Gonzalo Paniagua Javier</a>
	
	<p><b>Integration with Windows.Forms</b> needs to be started, such as, data binding 
	to a System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.  This may involve implementing many classes
	in System.Windows.Forms and System.Data.
	
	<p><b>Integration with <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">GTK#</a></b> 
	needs to be started, such as, data binding
	to a GtkTreeView.  This may involve creating new classes
	to go between the glist data model and the ADO.NET data model.
	Mike Kestner would be the best person to ask for help on GTK#.
	
	<p><b>Integration with QT#</b> needs to be started.  Any information on 
	how this can be done is appreciated.  Adam Treat would be the best 
	person to ask about QT#.
	
	<p><b>Integration with GDA# and Libgnomedb#</b> which exists in GTK# needs
	to be started.  Creating classes
	to bind data between the data model in ADO.NET and the data model that
	exists in <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">GDA</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">libgnomedb</a>.  There are some nifty widgets
	(GUI controls) that can be used, such as, GnomeDbGrid, GnomeDbBrowswer, 
	GnomeDbSqlEditor, GnomeDbList, GnomeDbLogin, GnomeDbReportEditor, GnomeDbTableEditor, 
	GnomeDbCombo, and GnomeDbForm.
		
	<p><b>XML support in System.Data</b> needs to be started.  This involves working on
	the classes: DataSet, XmlDataDocument, and the method ExecuteXmlReader() that
	exists in a provider's class that implements IDbCommand, and others.
	
	<p><b>ADO.NET Multiplexor Provider</b> needs to be created.  This is not
	part of Microsoft .NET, but it needs to be able to run on Microsoft .NET
	and Mono.  This provider can be a generic provider, much like the ODBC.NET and
	OLEDB.NET providers are, but be written in 100% C# and be configurable via
	a configuration file.  This provider will multiplex to other providers
	that exist.  If one does not exist for a given DBMS, 
	default to the ODBC or OLEDB .NET provider.  Or it could be a class
	that its sole duty is to dynamically create a provider's Connection class
	based on a configuration file.  It can provide some utility functions as
	well that can be used in all or most of the providers, such as, what
	parameter marker character should be used: a colon, at, question mark,
	or square brackets.
	
	<p>According to Gonzalo, this is how it could be implemented:

	<p>After some work done in System.Configuration, you can now do something
    like:   

<pre>
    // Get an instance of the multiplexor from machine.config file
    // Can be overriden in the application config file	
    object o = ConnectionSettings.GetConfig ("mono.data/multiplexor");
    if (o == null)
    	--- error
    
    Multiplexor mp = (Multiplexor) o;
    
    // may be a string [] argument can help passing arguments
    IDbConnection cnc = mp.CreateConnection (providerName);
</pre>
    
    <p>and in the machine.config file:

<pre>
  <configuration>
   <configSections>
    <section name="mono.data"
      type="Mono.Data.MultiplexorSectionHandler,Mono.Data" />
    ....
   </configSections>
   ...
   <sectionGroup name="mono.data">
     <multiplexor>
       <add provider="PostgreSQL" type="Mono.Data.PostgreSQLClient,Mono.Data"
          validate="false" parameters="USER=xxx;HOST=127.0.0.1;DBNAME=xxx" />
     </multiplexor>
   </sectionGroup>
  </configuration>
</pre>

    <p>validate="false" tells MultiplexorSectionHandler not to load the Type
    until an instance is required. You can add more attributes or whatever
    inside <multiplexor> as long as MultiplexorSectionHandler parses it.

<pre>  
    public class MultiplexorSectionHandler :
    IConfigurationSectionHandler
    {
        public object Create (object parent, object configContext,
        XmlNode section)
        {
            Multiplexor mp;
        // Here you get the ChildNodes and set up a Multiplexor
        // instance that will hold the information needed to create 
        // instances of each provider. Only one instance will be 
        // created by the config system.
            return mp;
        }
    }
</pre>

    <p>This way, if our providers works with MS, the user can test them in both
    MS and mono by just adding a few lines to machine.config (i still have
    to upload a default machine.config file for mono). And this is the .NET
    way of doing it (of course, if you prefer, you can use the other config
    file. I just wanted to make people aware of this feature that now works
    on mono).

	
	<p><b>Building System.Data</b>
	
	<p>The System.Data.dll gets built with the rest of the class library.
	To compile the System.Data.dll assembly separately, you need:

	<b>On Unix</b>

	<ul>
		* update your mono sources. Be sure you have latest mcs.exe
		  and .dll's, since there have been many fixes needed for
		  compilation on Linux.

		* compile System.Data.dll:
<pre>
 cd mcs/class/System.Data<br>
 mcs --target library -o System.Data.dll @list
</pre>
	</ul>

	<b>On Windows</b>

	<ul>
		* update your mono sources. Be sure you have latest mcs.exe
		  and .dll's.  You can use the same method as Linux, 
		  or you can use NAnt.

		* To use NAnt:

<pre>
 cd mcs/class/System.Data
 ../../nant/NAnt.exe
</pre>
			
			This will automatically copy the System.Data.dll to Test.
			If you need to do a clean for the System.Data.dll assembly,<br><br>

<pre>			
 cd mcs/class/System.Data
 ../../nant/NAnt.exe clean
</pre>
	</ul>
