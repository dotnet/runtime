INTRODUCTION

	This directory (msvc) serves as a central location for all
	things needed to build the mono runtime using Microsoft Visual
	Studio.

BUILDING

	From this directory type:

	     msbuild.exe mono.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64

	msbuild must be in your path, it comes with the .NET Framework.

MAINTENANCE

	Source files added to the different project .target files matches project makefile structure.
	NOTE, all sources added to makefiles should also be added to corresponding targets files for consistency.
	Files that should not be build on Windows should be excluded  using this configuration:

	<ClCompile Include="$(MonoSourceLocation)\mono\mini\tramp-wasm.c">
		<ExcludedFromBuild>$(ExcludeFromWindowsBuild)</ExcludedFromBuild>
	</ClCompile>

	and at the begning of the target file have a property set when to exclude files. This example will always
	exclude the file, but could be condtional if needed:

	<PropertyGroup>
		<ExcludeFromWindowsBuild>true</ExcludeFromWindowsBuild>
	</PropertyGroup>

	All header files added to makefiles should be included in the different targets files for consistency.

	Each target file has a corresponding filter file, files added to target files should also be added to the corresponding
	filter file.
