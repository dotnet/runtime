* The Class Library

	The Class Library should be compatible with Microsoft's .NET
	implementation.  

	Ideally as much code as possible should be written using C#.
	In some cases we might either need to interface with code
	written in C for large chunks of functionality (libart and
	Gtk+ for example) or we would need to interface to the system
	libraries (libc on Unix for networking functions for
	example).  

** Using existing components from GNOME.

	Our current plan is to implement the GUI tools on top of
	Gtk+.  The only problem is that applications from Windows
	might expect to be able to pull the HWND property from the
	widgets and use PInvoke to call Windows functions.

** Class Library and Win32 dependencies.

	There are a few spots where the Win32 foundation is exposed to
	the class library (the HDC and HWND properties in the GDI+).
	It seems from casual inspection that these can be safely
	mapped to Gdk's GC and GdkWindow pointers without breaking anything.

	The only drawback is that support for PInvoke of Win32 code
	wont be available.  If this is necessary it could be possible
	in the future by reusing pieces of Wine, and probably using
	Wine as our toolkit, but we think that this is not as
	important as we will wrap GNOME elements in the meantime. 

*** Initial GDI+ and WinForms implementation

	The initial implementation will use Gtk+ as the underlying
	toolkit, but implementations for other windowing systems
	should be possible (particularly thinking about PDA devices
	here).

	Since Gtk+ 2.0 has been ported to other windowing systems
	other than X (frame buffer, Win32 and BeOS implementation
	exist) it should cover most uses for most users.

*** Database access

	Implementing the ADO.NET functionality can be done through
	reusing <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org">GNOME-DB</a> as
	GNOME-DB was implemented precisely to provide an ADO-like
	system for GNOME.

*** Component Integration

	We will provide a new namespace to use GNOME specific features
	as well as a namespace to host Bonobo interfaces and classes
	in Mono.  

** Licensing

	The class library will be licensed under the terms of the GNU
	LGPL.

	We suggest that you assign the copyright of your work to the
	GNOME Foundation or the Free Software Foundation to simplify
	defending the code in case it is used inappropiately. 

** Contributing

	We welcome contributions to the the Class Library, you can
	check the status page.  Our status page describes which APIs
	are being worked on and the contact information for the
	contributor.
