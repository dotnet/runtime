* Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame

Without the help, the skills and the time of many passionate developers outside of 
the Ximian Mono team, Mono would not be where it is today.

Many of them do it for fun, some do it because they really want a nice CLR they 
can hack on, some do it because they need a working solution to some development 
issues and mono is the ideal tool for the job. 

Some of them may start contributing because they want a mention in the
<b>Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</b>! Whatever the cause, join us in a big<br>
<h1 align="center">Thank you!</h1>

* Mono Hackers

** Zoltan Vargaz

Zoltan has contributed significantly to Mono, with bug reports and bug 
fixes as well as pushing the envelope of the things that can be done in
and with the mono runtime: the gcc-based ngen compiler, code coverage
and more recently his work with Reflection.Emit that got mono to the 
point of running the IKVM Java virtual machine.

** Sergey Chaban

Sergey has been a long time contributor to the project, from the early
work on the class libraries that were critical to Mono's origin: every
time you use a Hashtable in Mono, it runs Sergey's code, to the
low-level optimizations on the JIT engine and to his work on ILASM and
the PEToolkit.  And countless other things.

** Nick Drochak

The first, deserved, entry in the <b>Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</b> is for
Nick Drochak, who joined us in the first days of Mono and built the testing 
infrastructure for the C# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured 
himself in the lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping
Mono on the right track through the daily changes in the codebase.
