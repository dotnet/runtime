* Testing

	Testing is an important part of the Mono project: every one of its
	three major components has a test suite tailored for its needs.  This
	is very helpful, because in the course of developing the software it
	is very common to introduce bugs in existing code.  A test suite
	helps us fix the bugs as soon as they are introduced.

** Class Library Tests

	All classes in Mono libraries should have comprehensive unit test
	suites to go with them. Unit testing is a software engineering
  	methodology that makes it easier to build correct code. Every
  	method in every class should have a set of tests to verify
  	that they work correctly. Mono also needs a testing framework
	to make it easy to write and run lots of tests. 

	Try <a href="http://nunit.sourceforge.net">NUnit</a>

	Why do unit testing? It becomes simple to run automated tests
	for the whole library. Unit tests are a safety net - you can
	change part of the code and verify that you haven't broken
	anything. Ideally, tests are written before the actual library
	code itself. And every time a bug is discovered, a test should
	be written to demonstrate the bug and its fix. Then, if
	you ever reintroduce the bug, you will know immediately. For
	more info, read <a

** Getting Started

	We welcome all contributions to the Class Libary Test Suite.

	There is information to help you get started in CVS at
	mcs/class/doc/NUnitGuidelines. Once you have written your test, please
	post it to <a href="mailing-lists.html">mono-list</a>.

	Someone will make sure to add the file or apply the patch as
	appropriate. If you plan to be an on-going contributor and
	would like to get cvs account, email <a href="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel</a>.

	Normally, after you send a couple of well-written new files
	and/or patches to the list, you will be given cvs access.
