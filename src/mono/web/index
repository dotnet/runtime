@item Sep 3rd, 2003: Authenticode; WSE

	
@item Sep 1st, 2003: Ice for Mono;  XmlSerializer generators; Monodoc progress.

	<b>Ice:</b> Vladimir has checked into CVS (Module ginzu) an
	implementation of <a href="http://www.zeroc.com">ZeroC's</a>
	<a href="http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html">ICE</a> protocol.  It
	is implemented using Remoting.  If you were looking for an
	efficient binary protocol to use with Remoting, this is it.

	ICE is simpler to use than CORBA, and was created by people
	who were deeply involved in CORBA and wanted to fix its
	problems (you can see a <a
	href="http://www.zeroc.com/iceVsCorba.html">list of
	differences</a>).

	<b>XmlSerializer</b>: Lluis has checked in a new technology
	for use in our XmlSerializer: the XmlSerializer code
	generator.  Currently our XmlSerializer generates a
	description of instructions for serializing data, these
	instructions are later interpreted while using it: Reflection
	is used to pull all the data.  The code generator is the first
	step into turning the Serializer from an intepreter into a
	compiler and improving the performance of it.

	Currently was used internally to implement the WSDL
	serializer, in the future it will just be part of the standard
	serialization process.

	<b>MonoDoc:</b> New providers!  Thanks to <a
	href="http://www.jaggersoft.com/">Jon Jagger</a> for providing
	us with his master XML files for the C# specification we now
	have integrated the C# spec into Monodoc.  Another provider is
	the Error provider: now we include all the C# compiler errors
	in the help system.

	Alp has contributed various user interface improvement, and
	updated our list widget for key navigation; Ben made the
	matches window more useful and Joshua has helped us clean up
	the ECMA provider even more.

@item Aug 14th, 2003: Mono 0.26 has been released

	A new version of Mono is available, the new features include:
	<a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo support</a>, <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sf.net">Remoting.Corba</a>
	support, as well as a managed XSLT implementation.  

	Existing features have been improved vastly: better
	Windows.Forms, runtime, faster compiler, web services, better
	compliance to the spec and more. 

	Check out the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.26.html">Release
	notes</a> for details.

@item Aug 9th, 2003: Python for .NET Preview 2 available;  Mono Documentation site up.

	Brian Lloyd has <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-August/015313.html">announced</a>
	the availability of his Python binding to .NET.  This works
	with .NET and Mono.  For more information about it, see
	Brian's site at <a href="
	http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/">http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/</a>

	We have uploaded the current Mono Documentation (core
	libraries and Gtk#) to <a
	href="http://mono.ximian.com:8080"/>http://mono.ximian.com:8080</a>.
	The site is running the ASP.NET edition of <a
	href="archive/monodoc-0.6.tar.gz">MonoDoc 0.6</a> on XSP.

@item Aug 6th, 2003: Winforms samples

	Timothy Parez is coordinating the effort to create sample
	programs that exercise the various Windows.Forms controls.  We
	are using this as graphical regression test suite for the Mono
	implementation.

	The screenshots of the various widgets, together with the
	source code is available on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">WineSamples</a>
	page on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/">Mono Wiki</a>.

	A new cvs module called `winforms' has been created that
	contains the source code for the samples.  To run the samples,
	you can install the WineLib packages available from our <a
	href="download.html">download page</a>.

@item Aug 5th, 2003: New Apache Module architecture: 1.3 and 2.x supported

	Gonzalo rearchitected our Apache module for hosting Mono and
	ASP.NET.  The previous incarnation hosted a Mono runtime on
	each Apache process, which lead to a slow setup for webforms.
	The new setup uses a shared mono process for all the incoming
	requests.  Daniel later improved up the new architecture and
	added dual support, so now in addition to Apache 2.x, we
	support Apache 1.3 with the same codebase.

	The new code is available on CVS, on module `mod_mono', and
	now requires an XSP installation to be available. 

@item Aug 4th, 2003: Ximian acquired by Novell.

	Today <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> acquired <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>.  The press release is
	available <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com./about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=novell">here</a>.

	Mono and Gnome form an integral part of the Novell strategy.

@item Jul 30th, 2003: Remoting.CORBA, Managed XSLT.

	Today Lluis announced that Mono CVS contains all the fixes to
	run <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">Remoting.CORBA</a>:
	both client and server channels work; We are interested in people
	testing it with other ORBs.

	Ben checked-in today his managed implementation of Xslt that
	we mentioned on Jul 19th; This uncovered various limitations
	on the XPath implementation, which Piers has swifly removed.
	Monodoc, NUnit and our Corcompare work with it.  Since this is
	implementation is not completed yet, we still support the
	libxslt-based version by default.  For more details on how to
	try the new XSLT implementation, see <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001681.html">Ben's
	post</a>

@item Jul 27th, 2003: Wine packages and Daily Snapshots 

	MonoWine packages (used to run System.Windows.Forms) software
	are now available from our (<a
	href="download.html">download</a> page).  You can track the
	progress on our <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">Wiki
	page.</a>

	We're now building daily snapshots of Mono.  They come in
	three distinct flavors:

	<ul>
		* mono snapshot tarballs - These are 'release-style' tarballs and
		  contain everything necessary to setup a new
		  installation from scratch.  This includes the Mono
	 	  runtime and all the assemblies we distribute.

		* monocharge tarballs - These tarballs contain only
		  the assemblies built on that day.

		* monolite tarballs - These tarballs contain a copy of
		  'corlib.dll', 'mcs.exe', 'System.dll', 'System.Xml.dll' and
		  'Mono.CSharp.Debugger.dll'. They can be used to
		  re-bootstrap an out-of-sync installation.
	</ul>

	The daily builds are availble here: <a href="http://go-mono.com/daily">http://go-mono.com/daily</a>

	If you find that the builds are broken, please notify Duncan.

@item Jul 19th, 2003: Recent developments

	Since Mono has matured, we have limited the news on the site
	to major accomplishments that are finished, but this week, it
	is worth devoting some time to talk about some of the
	work-in-progress projects that are progressing.

	Jackson has added support to the IL assembler for generics as
	well as to the PEAPI library, and it has assembled its first
	generic program.  Support for handling images with generics
	has been on our file format reader for a while, but the JIT
	engine is still incomplete. 

	On the XSLT world, Atsushi and Ben continue to make big
	improvements.  Ben recently got the prototype managed XSLT
	implementation to run its first stylesheet.  Although
	currently Mono uses libxslt to implement the System.Xml.Xsl
	namespace, to have a fully .NET compliant implementation we
	will need a managed version, and this is the beginning of it.

	Lluis recently posted an update on the <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001550.html">state
	of WSDL</a> in Mono.  Now that the web services runtime is
	ready, the WSDL compiler becomes more important as a
	development tool.

	Atsushi continues his work on the DTD validating reader in
	System.Xml, as well as improving our XML Schema support.

@item Jul 14th, 2003: New build system;  IPV6 support.

	Peter Williams has contributed a new build system that
	addresses many of the annoyance we had with our previous build
	system.  He has worked on this for a few weeks, and Gonzalo
	helped test it and get it into CVS.  We no longer have the
	historical dual build system: make for Unix and nant for
	Windows.

	This system also offers the opportunity to compile our class
	libraries with different profiles (.NET 1.0, .NET 1.1 and the
	various ECMA subsets).

	Peter explains the new build system <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001506.html">here</a>

	Jerome's IPV6 code has been checked into CVS; With Peter's new
	build system, we will be able to expose it (as part of the
	NET_1_1 build).

@item Jul 9th, 2003: ASP.NET web services, coverage tools.

	Web Services keep advancing: now we also support server-side
	authoring of Web Services as well as web service clients
	(which shipped in Mono 0.25).  This works using our ASP.NET
	runtime, so it works with either XSP or the Apache module. The
	new Web Services work from Lluis added the missing bits:
	<ul>
		<li> .asmx files.
		<li> Method calls with complex parameters (whatever XmlSerializer can currently serialize, which is a quite a lot).
		<li> ref and out parameters.
		<li> Soap headers (In, Out and InOut).
		<li> Soap extensions, both global (configured in web.config) and particular to methods (configured using attributes).
	</ul>

	For more details, see Lluis <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001449.html">post</a>

	GUI-wise: Work on <a href="http://xr.xwin.org">Xr</a> to
	implement System.Drawing continues.  This will provide a full
	GDI+ implementation for Mono, and this will be hooked up into
	Gtk# and System.Windows.Forms.

	MonoDoc keeps moving along, with a new web-based version
	coming up next, and we are also exploring a collaborative
	extension to allow people to contribute documentation through
	their web browsers.

	Zoltan's Coverage analysis tool has been checked into CVS.
	With this tool it is now possible to find which class library
	code paths are missing regression tests.  The module is
	`monocov'.  Details are <a
	href="http://www.nexus.hu/vargaz/">here</a>.  A fresh Gtk#
	version is available now.

	Jean's remoting-based Soap implenentation is also maturing.

@item Jun 26th: Mono 0.25 has been released.

	We have released Mono 0.25.  A list of the new features is
	available <a href="archive/mono-0.25.html">here</a>.  

	Packages for Windows, and various Linux distributions are
	available on our <a href="download.html">download</a> page.

@item Jun 17th, 2003: Web Services client; Profiling hooks

	Lluis and Gonzalo have checked into CVS the support for web
	services in the Mono runtime.  This allows Mono to work as a
	web services client.  We still require a WSDL compiler to
	compile the initial stub, but Erik has the beginning of a WSDL
	compiler ready and Atsushi has continued work on his
	experimental Xml Schema to C# class generator.  

	As part of this, the Mono Http runtime has been rewritten to
	increase reliability, scalability and conformance to the
	specs.  Also our io-layer has been extended to not have
	arbitrary limits.  This was done as part of our collaboration
	with SourceGear.

	Paolo has commited the new pluggable profiling API to the Mono
	runtime: now the profiler is built as a module, and a new code
	coverage analysis has been checked in (and Zoltan already
	added improvements to it).

	Mark's Mozilla bindings continue to improve, and we will shortly
	migrate the Mono documentation browser to use Mozilla, to take
	advantage of the tutorial's use of CSS.

	Jackson's work on the IL assembler and Ben on running
	regression tests have provided us with a very needed tool in
	the Mono toolkit.  One of the last missing pieces on the SDK.

	On the crypto world, we got Sebastien's certificate viewer
	checked into CVS and the crypto code keeps advancing by leaps
	and bounds.

	Alexandre and Aleksey Work continues on Windows.Forms on top
	of Wine and Gtk# (the former for full compatibility, the later
	for ease-of-authoring).

	Cesar checked in the beginning of the semantic analysis code
	for his JScript compiler, and will be working on it full time.

@item Jun 11th, 2003: SourceGear and Ximian announce partnership

	Ximian, Inc., the leading provider of desktop and server
	solutions enabling enterprise Linux adoption, today announced
	that SourceGear Corporation will use Mono\x{2122} Project
	technology to offer cross-platform versions of its
	products. In addition, the companies have entered into a
	development partnership under which Ximian will provide
	custom Mono development to enable delivery of SourceGear
	products later this year. As a result, SourceGear will offer
	both UNIX and Linux clients for its SourceGear Vault source
	code management tool, enabling broader use of its solutions in
	mixed-platform development organizations.

@item Jan, 19th, 2003: Mono Debugger released.

	After six month of extensive development, Martin Baulig has
	released the first version of the Mono debugger.  The Mono
	debugger is written in C# and can debug both managed and
	unmanaged applications, support for multiple-threaded
	applications and should be relatively easy to port to new
	platforms.  

	Details of the release are available in <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/005192.html">post</a>. 

	The debugger contains both Gtk# and command line interfaces.
	The debugging file format used in Dwarf (its already supported
	by our class libraries and the Mono C# compiler; To debug C
	applications, you need a recent GCC, or to pass the -gdwarf-2
	flag to gcc).
	
@item Jan, 17th, 2003: DB2 provider, MacOS X

@item Jan 3rd, 2003: Glade#, Code Coverage, Apache, MBas, Debugger.

	Rachel has made Glade# use attributes so binding C# widgets to
	the designed widgets is now easier than ever.  Alp has
	improved this to use implicit names as well.

	Martin's Mono debugger now has support for multi-thread
	debugging.  Special feature: breakpoints can be defined in a
	per-thread basis now.

	Daniel López has checked in his Apache module to integrate
	Mono and Mono's ASP.NET support as an Apache module.  Gonzalo
	has folded his new Mono hosting classes into this module (they
	are now shared between XSP and mod_mono).  You can get the
	mod_apache from CVS (module name: mod_mono). 

	Mono Basic improvements: Marco has added support for more
	statements on the grammar.

	Zoltan has <a href="http://www.nexus.hu/vargaz2/">posted</a>
	his Code Coverage analysis tool for Mono.

	Mono 0.17 has been released.  Check out the <a
	href="archive/mono-0.17">release notes</a> for a more detailed
	list.   You can get it <a href="download.html">here</a>.

	Many new features as well as plenty of bug fixes.  Many new
	System.Data providers and a more mature System.Web (ASP.NET)
	which can now be hosted in any web server.  A simple <a
	href="archive/xsp-0.2.tar.gz">test web server</a> to host
	asp.net has been released as well.

	This version also integrates Neale's s390 port.

	This release also includes a new exception handling system
	that uses the gcc exception information that vastly improves
	our internalcall speed (15% faster mcs compilation times).   

@item Dec 8th, 2002: VB.NET, Oracle Provider.

	Marco has got the Mono Basic compiler up to speed (support for
	classes, modules, expressions, object creation, method
	invocation, local variables, and some statements).  The
	compiler is based on the work from Rafael Teixeira on MCS.

@item Nov 8th, 2002: Mono s390, Database work, new JIT updates.

	Neale Ferguson has contributed <a href="download.html">RPM
	packages</a> of Mono for the Linux/s390.

	Tim Coleman posted an <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003329.html">update</a>
	on the improvements in the System.Data

	The new JIT engine can run 72 out of our 154 tests for the
	virtual machine, and it also got exception support this week.

@item Nov 1st, 2002: TDS, Crypto, Gtk#, Winforms, bug fixes.

	Tim's SqlClient is <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003161.html">now
	capable</a> of communicating with the Microsoft SQL server
	using the TDS protocol.  A screenshot showing a sample client
	running with <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> on
	Windows is shown <a
	href="images/SqlSharpGtkSceenshot3.png">here</a>

	Sebastien has made all symetric ciphers functional on all
	supported modes; All the classes in Security.Cryptography are
	present and the X590 certificates are now in too.  Jackson has
	been working on the Security classes.

	Many bug fixes all over the place: class libraries (Dick,
	Piers, Ville, Zoltan, Gonzalo, Dan, Atsushi, Nick, Phillip),
	compiler, runtime engine.  A big thank goes for everyone who
	has been providing bug reports for us to track down.

	Gaurav has been working on multiple WebControls.  Gonzalo migrated
	the ASP.NET engine to use POST for interaction.

	In the Gtk# land saw the integration of gda, gnome-db and GStreamer
	bindings.

	Windows.Forms classes now build on Linux and Windows, check
	out the status pages for areas of collaboration.

@item Oct 24th, 2002: S390 support, XSP/ASP.NET, Win32 contributors, TDS.

	Today Neal Ferguson's support for the IBM S390 was checked
	into CVS.

	The XSP processor has been fully integrated into the
	System.Web assembly, and Gonzalo has finished the hosting
	interfaces in Mono.  This means that it is possible to embed
	ASP.NET with the same APIs used in Windows, and is possible to
	easily embed it with Apache for example.  The XSP module has
	now become a shell for testing the System.Web classes.

	We are looking for contributors that know Win32 to contribute
	to the Windows.Forms implementation.  If you want to help
	write some controls using the Win32 API, get in touch with our new <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mono-winforms-list@ximian.com
	list</a> mailing list. 

	Tim's TDS System.Data set of classes can now talk to SQL
	servers using the TDS protocol (version 4.2) with
	connection pooling.  Currently it can connect, run
	transactions, update/insert/delete, and read some types.  A
	data adapter is also coming soon.
	
@item Oct 21th, 2002: Crypto, Winforms list, Database, GConf, Debugger.

	Sebastien Poliot has made a lot of progress, he reports that
	DES and TripleDES have been fixed;  Rijndael and CFB modes
	still have problems in some configurations and some areas that
	are not supported by the .NET framework.

	Last week we created a new <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mailing
	list</a> to discuss the Mono Winforms implementation.

	Tim has started a full C# implementation of the TDS protocol
	and the providers, and Brian continues his work on his ODBC
	binding.  

	Rachel Hestilow has also checked in a binding for GConf.  This
	binding <a
	href="http://toxic.magnesium.net/~hestilow/gconfsharp/intro.html">is
	unique</a> in that it uses some features in the CLI to support
	complex data types, and allows the user to keep only one
	representation of the types instead of two (the master types
	is defined in CLI-land).  Also Property Editors (<a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/gconf-shot.png">shot</a>)
	simplify the creation of user interfaces that bind their
	configuration to backend keys, following the <a
	href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/">GNOME
	Human Interface Guidelines.</a>

	Martin is now on vacation, but before leaving he produced a
	number of documents detailing the state of the debugger.  The
	major missing feature is full support for debugging unmanaged
	applications (it requires dwarf-2 handlers for types).  We
	will do some polishing of the user interface (<a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/debugger-4.png">new
	shot</a>) to expose the existing and rich functionality to the
	users and try to release a preview of the debugger at the same
	time as Mono 0.17.

@item Oct 14th, 2002: Crypto, Database work, Debugger, Documentation.

	Brian, Daniel and Rodrigo have been busy working on the ODBC
	provider for Mono.  Daniel posted some <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002755.html">updates</a>.
	Brian posted <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002758.html">details
	about the ODBC.NET</a> provider.

	Also Sebastien Pouliot has been improving the various
	cryptographic classes in Mono, something that we had not done
	in quite some time.  We are looking for a way to handle
	big-nums.  We need either a managed or unmanaged set of
	classes for handling large numbers, and some volunteers to
	expose this functionality to C# (Either as an internal
	assembly, or as a set of P/Invoke, Internal call wrappers).

	Martin has got our debugger to support adding breakpoints at
	file/line combos.  This was more complex than generic
	breakpoints in routines, because these breakpoints are set on
	routines that probably have not been JITed just yet.  Martin's
	focus now is on stabilizing our debugger and aim for a public
	release of it.

	We have also imported the ECMA documentation into a separate
	module, and with the help from Scott Bronson we will have the
	necessary XSLT tools to finish our native documentation
	browser for Mono.  This together with the work from Adam will
	be the foundation for the <a href="classlib-doc.html">Mono
	Documentation Tools</a>. 

@item Oct 9th, 2002: Various Mono updates.

	Brian Ritchie, Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya and Ville Palo have
	been working on various database providers.  The MySQL has
	seen a lot of work, and a new ODBC provider is now on CVS and
	more extensive regression tests have been checked in.

	Dick Porter is our background hero and keeps fixing the
	low-level bugs in the portability layer.  Now the Mono handle
	daemon should be a lot more robust and will no longer leave IPC
	regions.  Gonzalo Paniagua has initiated the migration of XSP
	into the System.Web class libraries now that we have a
	complete HttpRuntime implementation.  This means that you are
	able to embed the ASP.NET processor into any web server you
	want.  This also includes support for the system-wide
	configuration file `machine.config'.

	Martin Baulig has been busy with the Mono Debugger, you can see how
	it looks <a

	Now local variables and breakpoints are supported, and we are
	working on the UI elements to simplify their use (as seen on
	the screenshot).  

	<a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> has seen a lot of
	activity specially as we start to build larger applications.
	Vladimir Vukicevic, Kristian Rietveld, Rachel Hestilow, Mike
	Kestner and Miguel de Icaza have been busy improving it.
	mPhoto which is a Photo management application for Mono and
	Gtk# is seen <a

	Chris Toshok the man behind LDAP in Evolution continues to
	work on the Mono.LDAP# implementation.

	Dietmar Maurer and Paolo Molaro are still busy working on our
	new optimized JIT/ATC engine and are making great progress.
	The code base has been designed to ease the implementation of
	more advanced compiler optimizations, and optimizations can be
	chosen individually so they can be tuned for a particular
	processor, or use profile-based information to improve the
	performance.

@item Oct 1st, 2002: Mono 0.16 released;  Debugger updates.

	Mono 0.16 has been released.  Source and RPMs are <a
	href="download.html">available</a>.  The release notes are <a
	href="archive/mono-0.16">here</a>.  

	Martin's debugger can debug both managed and unmanaged code.
	Recently Martin added support for locals, parameters, and
	breakpoints on top of the existing infrastructure (his
	debugger supported instruction-level and source-code level
	single-stepping).

@item Sep 17th, 2002: Mono Hackers Hall of Fame: Sergey Chaban 

	The <a href="hackers.html">Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</a>
	continues to show our appreciation to the excellent
	contributors that made <b>mono::</b> a successful free
	software project.

	This time the Hall of Fame welcomes Sergey Chaban.  Sergey has
	been a long time contributor to the project, from the early
	work on the class libraries that were critical to Mono's
	origin: every time you use a Hashtable in Mono, it runs
	Sergey's code, to the low-level optimizations on the JIT
	engine and to his work on ILASM and the PEToolkit. 

	
@item Sep 16th, 2002: Documentation Tools, ILASM, Debugger, Mono LDAP, Winforms

	Adam Treat has started moving the documentation universe again.  We
	have a new strategy to document our APIs (given that we have
	chosen <a href="classlib-doc.html">not to document the code
	inline</a>).  This includes the use of a master reference file
	that will hold the entry points to document.  All master files
	for our assemblies have been checked into CVS now.

	Sergey Chaban's Mono.PEToolkit and ILASM tools have been
	checked into CVS.  Although ILASM is old and will soon be
	updated, we wanted to get the build issues sorted out.

	Martin Baulig's Mono Debugger is still on its early stages,
	but you can run and run step by step your C# code and C code
	(including the Mono runtime).  Dwarf-2 is required to compile
	your code.  The regular step, step-into, and assembly-level
	step and step-into are supported.  And comes with a Gtk#
	UI. The debugger is written mostly in C# with some C glue
	code.  Most of the work is on the engine, we will be working
	on making a good UI in the future.

	Chris Toshok of the Hungry Programmer's fame has checked in
	Mono.Directory.LDAP, a C# wrapper for the LDAP libraries.
	This is the substrate for implementing the
	System.DirectoryServices assembly.

	Andrew has also continued with some of the cryptographic
	classes implementation.

	After much public debate, we have chosen a new <a
	href="winforms.html">strategy to implement winforms</a>.
	Implementing a Gtk, Qt or Aqua based version of Winforms was
	going to be almost as complex as implementing Wine itself.  So
	the new strategy is to only roll out a WineLib-based
	implementation. 

@item Sep 4th, 2002: .NET One 2002 Program available

	The <a
	href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/dotnet_2002/index.htm">.NET
	ONE 2002</a> conference in Frankfurt is now available.  Paolo
	will be talking about the Mono JIT and embedding the Mono
	runtime in your Windows and Linux applications.  Mike Kestner
	will talk about <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> and
	the automatic binding generator used by Gtk# and Miguel will
	be talking about the Mono project on Monday's keynote and on
	the Mono C# compiler on Tuesday.

@item Sep 3rd, 2002: Apache integration

	<a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-September/001862.html">Sterling</a>
	announced an Apache module that hosts
	Mono, and allows CIL code to run from within Apache, giving the
	module access to the Apache runtime.  This uses the Mono embedding
	API.

@item Aug 24th, 2002: Gtk# 0.4 released

	Shortly after <a href="download.html">Mono 0.15</a> was
	released a fresh version of <a
	href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> was <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-August/001702.html">announced</a>.

@item Aug 23rd, 2002: Mono 0.15 released

	Mono 0.15 has been released.  Source and RPMs are <a
	href="download.html">available</a>.  The release notes are <a
	href="archive/mono-0.15">here</a>

@item Aug 21th, 2002: Portable.NET encodings integrated into Mono.

	Rhys Weatherley has contributed the Portable.NET encoders to
	the Mono class libraries.  This is a great step towards
	cooperation between these projects.  Thanks to Paolo for doing the
	merger on our side.

	His encoders are more complete than the iconv-based approach
	that mono used, which was unreliable under certain
	circumstances.  

@item Aug 20th, 2002: Remoting work, Resources, SPARC checkins, ADO.NET

	<b>San Francisco</b>: August 14th.  Linux World Expo.

	Mark Crichton has checked in his patches to get the SPARC port
	on par with the PPC port.

	Dick has checked-in the resource reader and resource writers
	to the class libraries, and Dietmar checked in the C# support
	code for the remoting infrastructure.  

	More work on System.Data: the LibGDA (our OleDB backend) based
	providers are quickly maturing, and recently they executed
	their first query.

@item Aug 13th, 2002: MCS news, Gtk# progress, Windows.Forms, ADO.NET

	Martin Baulig has been fixing all the known bugs in the C#
	compiler and now has moved into improving the compilation
	speed and the generated code quality of MCS.  Today we got a
	50% speedup in the bootstrap of MCS going from 24 seconds to 12 seconds. 

	Gtk# has been making a lot of progress, some interesting
	corner cases are now supported:, you can now create canvas items as
	well as using the tree widget.  Here is a shot of <a
	href="images/mocil.png">MonoCIL</a>.

	On the runtime front, focus has been on improving remoting
	support, exception handling, as well as completing the support
	for structure marshaling.  

	Patrik is also back in action: the HttpRuntime infrastructure
	is rapidly improving, and Gonzalo is working into moving XSP
	into our main class library and providing the missing pieces
	to integrate with Patrik's code.

	Dennis and his team are working on a WineLib-based
	implementation of Windows Forms to guarantee that the corner
	cases of Windows.Forms can be handled, and we are back on track again.

	A lot more work on the ADO.NET and WebServices has also been
	checked into CVS.

@item Aug 1st, 2002: Mono Hackers Hall of Fame

	The <a href="hackers.html">Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</a> has been started
	to show our appreciation to the excellent contributors that made <b>mono::</b>
	a successful free software project.

	The first, deserved, entry goes to
	Nick Drochak, who joined us in the first days of Mono and built the testing 
	infrastructure for the C# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured 
	himself in the lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping
	Mono on the right track through the daily changes in the codebase.
