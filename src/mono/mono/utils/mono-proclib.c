/*
 * Recap from Alexander KÃ¶plinger <alex.koeplinger@outlook.com>:
 *
 * When we merged the change from mono/mono PR #2722, we started seeing random failures on ARM in
 * the MonoTests.System.Threading.ThreadPoolTests.SetAndGetMaxThreads and
 * MonoTests.System.Threading.ManualResetEventSlimTests.Constructor_Defaults tests. Both
 * of those tests are dealing with Environment.ProcessorCount to verify some implementation
 * details.
 *
 * It turns out that on the Jetson TK1 board we use on public Jenkins and on ARM kernels
 * in general, the value returned by sched_getaffinity (or _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) doesn't
 * contain CPUs/cores that are powered off for power saving reasons. This is contrary to
 * what happens on x86, where even cores in deep-sleep state are returned [1], [2]. This
 * means that we would get a processor count of 1 at one point in time and a higher value
 * when load increases later on as the system wakes CPUs.
 *
 * Various runtime pieces like the threadpool and also user code however relies on the
 * value returned by Environment.ProcessorCount e.g. for deciding how many parallel tasks
 * to start, thereby limiting the performance when that code thinks we only have one CPU.
 *
 * Talking to a few people, this was the reason why we changed to _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF in
 * mono#1688 and why we added a special case for Android in mono@de3addc to get the "real"
 * number of processors in the system.
 *
 * Because of those issues Android/Dalvik also switched from _ONLN to _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
 * for the Java API Runtime.availableProcessors() too [3], citing:
 * > Traditionally this returned the number currently online, but many mobile devices are
 * able to take unused cores offline to save power, so releases newer than Android 4.2 (Jelly
 * Bean) return the maximum number of cores that could be made available if there were no
 * power or heat constraints.
 *
 * The problem with sticking to _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF however is that it breaks down in
 * constrained environments like Docker or with an explicit CPU affinity set by the Linux
 * `taskset` command, They'd get a higher CPU count than can be used, start more threads etc.
 * which results in unnecessary context switches and overloaded systems. That's why we need
 * to respect sched_getaffinity.
 *
 * So while in an ideal world we would be able to rely on sched_getaffinity/_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN
 * to return the number of theoretically available CPUs regardless of power saving measures
 * everywhere, we can't do this on ARM.
 *
 * I think the pragmatic solution is the following:
 * * use sched_getaffinity (+ fallback to _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN in case of error) on x86. This
 * ensures we're inline with what OpenJDK [4] and CoreCLR [5] do
 * * use _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF exclusively on ARM (I think we could eventually even get rid of
 * the HOST_ANDROID special case)
