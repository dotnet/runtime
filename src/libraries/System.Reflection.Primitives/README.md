# System.Reflection.Primitives
Contains reflection types such as [TypeAttributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection.typeattributes). Some of these types are forwarded to the runtime. In the future, the non-forwarded types may be lifted to the runtime and then type forwards added.
