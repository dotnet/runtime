# Notes (delete this section)

* For new APIs, follow http://aka.ms/apireview. This requires filing an issue
  that outlines the new API first. Before we accept PRs, it muse be reviewed by
  us and marked as `api-approved`.

* Do not create tracking PRs with pending work. Submit the PR when you're ready
  to review the changes with us. If you want to share work-in-progress PRs,
  create them in your own fork.

* Include a "Fixes #1 and #2" to link to the issue(s) this PR addresses.

* Include a summary of the problem and the change so that reviewers don't have
  to extract that information from the commit messages.
