<!--
For new APIs, follow http://aka.ms/apireview. This requires filing an issue
that outlines the new API first. Before we accept PRs, it must be reviewed by
us and marked as `api-approved`.

Do not create tracking PRs with pending work. Submit the PR when you want to
review the changes with us and believe the changes are ready to be merged.
If you want to share work-in-progress PRs, create them in your own fork.
