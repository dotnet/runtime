# System.Security.Principal

This assembly no longer contains any code.  It is provided only to permit type unification for libraries built against previous versions of .NET.

## Source

* All types previously part of this library are now part of [System.Private.CoreLib](../System.Private.CoreLib/), exposed via [System.Runtime](../System.Runtime/).

## Deployment

The System.Security.Principal assembly is part of the shared framework, and ships with every new release of .NET.
