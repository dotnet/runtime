# Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory

In-memory caching provides a general purpose memory implementation of the core caching abstractions provided under `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions` and it is great for apps that run in a single server, where all cached data rents memory in the app's process.

Documentation can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/caching.

## Contribution Bar
- [x] [We consider new features, new APIs, bug fixes, and performance changes](../../libraries/README.md#primary-bar)

The APIs and functionality need more investment in the upcoming .NET releases.

## Deployment
[Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory) is included in the ASP.NET Core shared framework. The package is deployed as out-of-band (OOB) too and can be referenced into projects directly.
