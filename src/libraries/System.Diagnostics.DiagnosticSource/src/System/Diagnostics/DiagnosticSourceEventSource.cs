    /// DiagnosticSourceEventSource serves two purposes
    ///
    ///   1) It allows debuggers to inject code via Function evaluation. This is the purpose of the
    ///   BreakPointWithDebuggerFuncEval function in the 'OnEventCommand' method. Basically even in
    ///   release code, debuggers can place a breakpoint in this method and then trigger the
    ///   DiagnosticSourceEventSource via ETW. Thus from outside the process you can get a hook that
    ///   is guaranteed to happen BEFORE any DiagnosticSource events (if the process is just starting)
    ///   or as soon as possible afterward if it is on attach.
    ///
    ///   2) It provides a 'bridge' that allows DiagnosticSource messages to be forwarded to EventListers
    ///   or ETW. You can do this by enabling the Microsoft-Diagnostics-DiagnosticSource with the
    ///   'Events' keyword (for diagnostics purposes, you should also turn on the 'Messages' keyword.
    ///
    ///   This EventSource defines a EventSource argument called 'FilterAndPayloadSpecs' that defines
    ///   what DiagnosticSources to enable and what parts of the payload to serialize into the key-value
    ///   list that will be forwarded to the EventSource. If it is empty, values of properties of the
    ///   diagnostic source payload are dumped as strings (using ToString()) and forwarded to the EventSource.
    ///   For what people think of as serializable object strings, primitives this gives you want you want.
    ///   (the value of the property in string form) for what people think of as non-serializable objects
    ///   (e.g. HttpContext) the ToString() method is typically not defined, so you get the Object.ToString()
    ///   implementation that prints the type name. This is useful since this is the information you need
    ///   (the type of the property) to discover the field names so you can create a transform specification
    ///   that will pick off the properties you desire.
    ///
    ///   Once you have the particular values you desire, the implicit payload elements are typically not needed
    ///   anymore and you can prefix the Transform specification with a '-' which suppresses the implicit
    ///   transform (you only get the values of the properties you specifically ask for.
    ///
    ///   Logically a transform specification is simply a fetching specification X.Y.Z along with a name to give
    ///   it in the output (which defaults to the last name in the fetch specification).
    ///
    ///   The FilterAndPayloadSpecs is one long string with the following structures
    ///
    ///   * It is a newline separated list of FILTER_AND_PAYLOAD_SPEC
    ///   * a FILTER_AND_PAYLOAD_SPEC can be

    ///       * EMPTY - turns on all sources with implicit payload elements.
    ///   * an EVENTNAME can be
    ///       * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME / DIAGNOSTIC_EVENT_NAME @ EVENT_SOURCE_EVENTNAME - give the name as well as the EventSource event to log it under.
    ///       * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME / DIAGNOSTIC_EVENT_NAME
    ///       * DIAGNOSTIC_SOURCE_NAME    - which wildcards every event in the Diagnostic source or
    ///       * EMPTY                     - which turns on all sources
    ///     Or it can be "[AS] ACTIVITY_SOURCE_NAME + ACTIVITY_NAME / ACTIVITY_EVENT_NAME - SAMPLING_RESULT"
    ///       * All parts are optional and can be empty string.
    ///       * ACTIVITY_SOURCE_NAME can be "*" to listen to all ActivitySources
    ///       * ACTIVITY_SOURCE_NAME can be empty string which will listen to ActivitySource that create Activities using "new Activity(...)"
    ///       * ACTIVITY_NAME is the activity operation name to filter with.
    ///       * ACTIVITY_EVENT_NAME either "Start" to listen to Activity Start event, or "Stop" to listen to Activity Stop event, or empty string to listen to both Start and Stop Activity events.
    ///       * SAMPLING_RESULT either:
    ///         * "Propagate" to create the Activity with PropagationData
    ///         * "Record" to create the Activity with AllData
    ///         * "ParentRatioSampler([ratio])" to create the Activity based on OTel parent + TraceId ratio algorithm. [ratio] should be a value between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).
    ///         * Empty string to create the Activity with AllDataAndRecorded
    ///   * TRANSFORM_SPEC is a semicolon separated list of TRANSFORM_SPEC, which can be
    ///       * - TRANSFORM_SPEC               - the '-' indicates that implicit payload elements should be suppressed
    ///       * VARIABLE_NAME = PROPERTY_SPEC  - indicates that a payload element 'VARIABLE_NAME' is created from PROPERTY_SPEC
    ///       * PROPERTY_SPEC                  - This is a shortcut where VARIABLE_NAME is the LAST property name
    ///   * a PROPERTY_SPEC is basically a list of names separated by '.'
    ///       * PROPERTY_NAME                  - fetches a property from the DiagnosticSource payload object
    ///       * PROPERTY_NAME . PROPERTY NAME  - fetches a sub-property of the object.
    ///
    ///       * *Activity                      - fetches Activity.Current
    ///       * *Enumerate                     - enumerates all the items in an IEnumerable, calls ToString() on them, and joins the
    ///                                          strings in a comma separated list.
    /// Example1:
    ///
    ///    "BridgeTestSource1/TestEvent1:cls_Point_X=cls.Point.X;cls_Point_Y=cls.Point.Y\r\n" +
    ///    "BridgeTestSource2/TestEvent2:-cls.Url"
    ///
    /// This indicates that two events should be turned on, The 'TestEvent1' event in BridgeTestSource1 and the
    /// 'TestEvent2' in BridgeTestSource2. In the first case, because the transform did not begin with a -
    /// any primitive type/string of 'TestEvent1's payload will be serialized into the output. In addition if
    /// there a property of the payload object called 'cls' which in turn has a property 'Point' which in turn
    /// has a property 'X' then that data is also put in the output with the name cls_Point_X. Similarly
    /// if cls.Point.Y exists, then that value will also be put in the output with the name cls_Point_Y.
    ///
    /// For the 'BridgeTestSource2/TestEvent2' event, because the - was specified NO implicit fields will be
    /// generated, but if there is a property call 'cls' which has a property 'Url' then that will be placed in
    /// the output with the name 'Url' (since that was the last property name used and no Variable= clause was
    /// specified.
    ///
    /// Example:
    ///
    ///     "BridgeTestSource1\r\n" +
    ///     "BridgeTestSource2"
    ///
    /// This will enable all events for the BridgeTestSource1 and BridgeTestSource2 sources. Any string/primitive
    /// properties of any of the events will be serialized into the output.
    ///
    /// Example:
    ///
    ///     ""
    ///
    /// This turns on all DiagnosticSources Any string/primitive properties of any of the events will be serialized
    /// into the output. This is not likely to be a good idea as it will be very verbose, but is useful to quickly
    /// discover what is available.
    ///
    /// Example:
    ///     "[AS]*"                      listen to all ActivitySources and all Activities events (Start/Stop). Activities will be created with AllDataAndRecorded sampling.
    ///     "[AS]"                       listen to default ActivitySource and Activities events (Start/Stop) while the Activity is created using "new Activity(...)". Such Activities will be created with AllDataAndRecorded sampling.
    ///     "[AS]MyLibrary/Start"        listen to `MyLibrary` ActivitySource and the 'Start' Activity event. The Activities will be created with AllDataAndRecorded sampling.
    ///     "[AS]MyLibrary/-Propagate"   listen to `MyLibrary` ActivitySource and the 'Start and Stop' Activity events. The Activities will be created with PropagationData sampling.
    ///     "[AS]MyLibrary/Stop-Record"  listen to `MyLibrary` ActivitySource and the 'Stop' Activity event. The Activities will be created with AllData sampling.
    ///     "[AS]*/-"                    listen to all ActivitySources and the Start and Stop Activity events. Activities will be created with AllDataAndRecorded sampling. this equivalent to "[AS]*" too.
    ///
    /// * How data is logged in the EventSource
    ///
    /// By default all data from DiagnosticSources is logged to the DiagnosticEventSource event called 'Event'
    /// which has three fields
    ///
    ///     string SourceName,
    ///     string EventName,
    ///     IEnumerable[KeyValuePair[string, string]] Argument
    ///
    /// However to support start-stop activity tracking, there are six other events that can be used
    ///
    ///     Activity1Start
    ///     Activity1Stop
    ///     Activity2Start
    ///     Activity2Stop
    ///     RecursiveActivity1Start
    ///     RecursiveActivity1Stop
    ///
    /// By using the SourceName/EventName@EventSourceName syntax, you can force particular DiagnosticSource events to
    /// be logged with one of these EventSource events. This is useful because the events above have start-stop semantics
    /// which means that they create activity IDs that are attached to all logging messages between the start and
    /// the stop (see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2015/09/14/exploring-eventsource-activity-correlation-and-causation-features/)
    ///
    /// For example the specification
    ///
    ///     "MyDiagnosticSource/RequestStart@Activity1Start\r\n" +
    ///     "MyDiagnosticSource/RequestStop@Activity1Stop\r\n" +
    ///     "MyDiagnosticSource/SecurityStart@Activity2Start\r\n" +
    ///     "MyDiagnosticSource/SecurityStop@Activity2Stop\r\n"
    ///
    /// Defines that RequestStart will be logged with the EventSource Event Activity1Start (and the corresponding stop) which
    /// means that all events caused between these two markers will have an activity ID associated with this start event.
    /// Similarly SecurityStart is mapped to Activity2Start.
    ///
    /// Note you can map many DiagnosticSource events to the same EventSource Event (e.g. Activity1Start). As long as the
    /// activities don't nest, you can reuse the same event name (since the payloads have the DiagnosticSource name which can
    /// disambiguate). However if they nest you need to use another EventSource event because the rules of EventSource
    /// activities state that a start of the same event terminates any existing activity of the same name.
    ///
    /// As its name suggests RecursiveActivity1Start, is marked as recursive and thus can be used when the activity can nest with
    /// itself. This should not be a 'top most' activity because it is not 'self healing' (if you miss a stop, then the
    /// activity NEVER ends).
