## Deployment
The `System.Xml.ReaderWriter` library is included in the shared framework and also shipped as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Xml.ReaderWriter). The NuGet package is considered "legacy" and should not be referenced by projects compatible with .NET Standard 2.0.
