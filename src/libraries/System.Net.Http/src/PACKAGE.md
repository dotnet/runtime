## About

Provides a programming interface for modern HTTP applications, including HTTP client components that allow applications to consume web services over HTTP and HTTP components that can be used by both clients and servers for parsing HTTP headers.

**NOTE:** System.Net.Http package is obsolete. You don't need to reference this package in your projects, because HTTP API is included in the shared framework. It is only provided for backwards compatibility.

For more information about HTTP API, see [System.Net.Http namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http).
