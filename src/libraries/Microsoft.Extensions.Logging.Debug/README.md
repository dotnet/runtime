# Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug

`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug` provides a Debug output logger provider implementation for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. This logger logs messages to a debugger monitor by writing messages with `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine()`.

Documentation can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging.
