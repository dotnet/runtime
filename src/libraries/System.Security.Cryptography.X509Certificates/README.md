# System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates

This assembly no longer contains any code.  It is provided only to permit type unification for libraries built against previous versions of .NET.

## Source

* All types previously part of this library are now part of the unified [System.Security.Cryptography](../System.Security.Cryptography/) library.

## Deployment

The System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates assembly is part of the shared framework, and ships with every new release of .NET.
