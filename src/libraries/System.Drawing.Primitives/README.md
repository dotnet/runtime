# System.Drawing.Primitives
This assembly exposes fundamental drawing APIs such as [`Point`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.point) and [`Size`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.size) which don't require access to native GDI+ libraries.

`System.Drawing.Primitives` supports not just Windows, but all officially supported platforms.

Documentation can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.
