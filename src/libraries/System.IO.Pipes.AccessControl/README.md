# System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl
This assembly no longer contains executable code, it contains the code for the reference assembly and the tests for the types formerly implemented.

## Source
* All types previously implemented on this library are now part of [System.IO.Pipes](../System.IO.Pipes/) library.

* Some of the tests for types previously in this library are still in the [tests](tests/) subdirectory.


## Contribution Bar
- [x] [We consider new features, new APIs and performance changes](../../libraries/README.md#primary-bar)
