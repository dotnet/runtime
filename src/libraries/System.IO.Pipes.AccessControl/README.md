# System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl
This assembly no longer contains executable code, it contains the code for the reference assembly and the tests for the types formerly implemented.

## Source
* All types previously implemented on this library are now part of [System.IO.Pipes](../System.IO.Pipes/) library.

* Some of the tests for types previously in this library are still in the [tests](tests/) subdirectory.

## Contribution Bar
- [x] We consider changes that move tests from the [tests](tests/) subdirectory into [System.IO.Pipes.Tests](../System.IO.Pipes/tests/) project.

## Deployment
The System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl assembly is part of the shared framework, and ships with every new release of .NET.
