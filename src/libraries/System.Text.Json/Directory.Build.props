    <PackageDescription>Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that serialize objects to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text and deserialize JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. Also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM), that is read-only, for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.

Commonly Used Types:
System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer
System.Text.Json.JsonDocument
System.Text.Json.JsonElement
System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonWriter
System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonReader</PackageDescription>
