Each library typically has its own `README.md` that identifies its current development status:
- **Active**
  - Under active development by the team
  - PRs for both features and fixes will be considered and championed
  - Issues will be considered for fix or addition to the backlog
- **Inactive**  
  - Under minimal development; quality is maintained
  - PRs for both features and fixes will be considered
  - Issues will be considered for fix or addition to the backlog
- **Legacy**  
  - Not under development; maintained for compatibility
  - PRs are unlikely to be accepted
  - Issues are likely to be closed without fix

Regardless of a library's status, refer to the [DOs and DON'Ts](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#dos-and-donts) in our contribution guidelines before submitting a pull request. For **Active** or **Inactive** areas, external contributors can request being assigned to issues in a comment.
