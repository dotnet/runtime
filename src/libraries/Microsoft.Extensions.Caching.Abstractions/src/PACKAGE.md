## About

<!-- A description of the package and where one can find more documentation -->

Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions offers the basics to create and use caching in your applications.

This library doesnâ€™t hold the actual caches, but it defines how caches should behave.
With this, you or other libraries can build various types of caches that all apps can use in the same way, whether the data is kept in memory, in files, or even across a network.

## Key Features

<!-- The key features of this package -->

* Basic rules and tools for building different kinds of caches.
* Makes it easier to create or use caches in your apps, whether they're simple or complex.

## How to Use

<!-- A compelling example on how to use this package with code, as well as any specific guidelines for when to use the package -->

This package is typically used with an implementation of the caching abstractions, such as `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` or `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.SqlServer`.
