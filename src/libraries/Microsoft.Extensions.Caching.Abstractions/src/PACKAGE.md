## About

<!-- A description of the package and where one can find more documentation -->

Provides the abstractions to create and use in-memory and distributed caching in your applications.

This library defines how in-memory and distributed caches should be implemented; it doesnâ€™t contain any cache implementation.
With the abstractions provided in this library, various types of caches can be built and used interchangeably, whether the data is kept in memory, in files, or even across a network.

## Key Features

<!-- The key features of this package -->

* Interfaces for building and using in-memory and distributed caches.

## How to Use

<!-- A compelling example on how to use this package with code, as well as any specific guidelines for when to use the package -->

This package is typically used with an implementation of the caching abstractions, such as `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` or `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.SqlServer`.
