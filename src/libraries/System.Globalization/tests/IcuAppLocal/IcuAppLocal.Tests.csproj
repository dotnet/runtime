      We define this switch dynamically during the runtime using RemoteExecutor.
      The reason is, if we enable ICU app-local here, this test will compile and run
      on all supported OSs even the ICU NuGet package not have native bits support such OSs.
      Note, it doesn't matter if we have test case conditioned to not run on such OSs, because
      the test has to start running first before filtering the test cases and the globalization
      code will run and fail fast at that time.
