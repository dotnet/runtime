    /// A logging provider implements the <see cref="ILogger" /> interface that gets invoked by the
    /// logging infrastructure whenever itâ€™s time to log a piece of state.
    ///
    /// A logging provider may also optionally implement the <see cref="IBufferedLogger" /> interface.
    /// The logging infrastructure may type-test the <see cref="ILogger" /> object to determine if
    /// it supports the <see cref="IBufferedLogger" /> interface. If it does, that indicates to the
    /// logging infrastructure that the logging provider supports buffering. Whenever log
    /// buffering is enabled, buffered log records may be delivered to the logging provider
    /// in a batch via <see cref="IBufferedLogger.LogRecords" />.
    ///
    /// If a logging provider does not support log buffering, then it will always be given
    /// unbuffered log records. If a logging provider does support log buffering, whether its
    /// <see cref="ILogger" /> or <see cref="IBufferedLogger" /> implementation is used is
    /// determined by the log producer.
