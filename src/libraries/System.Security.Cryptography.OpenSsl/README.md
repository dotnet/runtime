# System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl

This assembly no longer contains any code.  It is provided only to permit type unification for libraries built against previous versions of .NET.

## Contribution Bar

* We consider changes that move tests from the [tests](tests/) subdirectory into the unified [System.Security.Cryptography.Tests](../System.Security.Cryptography/tests/) project.
* We consider changes that add value to the tests, provided they cannot easily or effectively be added to the unified System.Security.Cryptography.Tests project.

## Source

* All types previously part of this library are now part of the unified [System.Security.Cryptography](../System.Security.Cryptography/) library.
* Some of the tests for types previously in this library are still in the [tests](tests/) subdirectory.

## Deployment

The System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl assembly is part of the shared framework, and ships with every new release of .NET.
