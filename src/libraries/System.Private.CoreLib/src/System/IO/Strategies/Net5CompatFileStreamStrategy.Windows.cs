/*
 * Win32FileStream supports different modes of accessing the disk - async mode
 * and sync mode.  They are two completely different codepaths in the
 * sync & async methods (i.e. Read/Write vs. ReadAsync/WriteAsync).  File
 * handles in NT can be opened in only sync or overlapped (async) mode,
 * and we have to deal with this pain.  Stream has implementations of
 * the sync methods in terms of the async ones, so we'll
 * call through to our base class to get those methods when necessary.
 *
 * Also buffering is added into Win32FileStream as well. Folded in the
 * code from BufferedStream, so all the comments about it being mostly
 * aggressive (and the possible perf improvement) apply to Win32FileStream as
 * well.  Also added some buffering to the async code paths.
 *
 * Class Invariants:
 * The class has one buffer, shared for reading & writing.  It can only be
 * used for one or the other at any point in time - not both.  The following
 * should be true:
 *   0 <= _readPos <= _readLen < _bufferSize
 *   0 <= _writePos < _bufferSize
 *   _readPos == _readLen && _readPos > 0 implies the read buffer is valid,
 *     but we're at the end of the buffer.
 *   _readPos == _readLen == 0 means the read buffer contains garbage.
 *   Either _writePos can be greater than 0, or _readLen & _readPos can be
 *     greater than zero, but neither can be greater than zero at the same time.
 *
