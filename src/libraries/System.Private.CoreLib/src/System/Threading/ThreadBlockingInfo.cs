    // - The type, some fields, and some other members may be used by debuggers (noted specifically below), so take care when
    //   renaming them
    //
    // Debuggers may use this info by evaluating expressions to enumerate the blocking infos for a thread. For example:
    // - Evaluate "System.Threading.ThreadBlockingInfo.t_first" to obtain the first pointer to a blocking info for the current
    //   thread
    // - While there is a non-null pointer to a blocking info:
    //   - Evaluate "(*(System.Threading.ThreadBlockingInfo*)ptr).fieldOrProperty", where "ptr" is the blocking info pointer
    //     value, to get the field and relevant property getter values below
    //   - Use the _objectKind field value to determine what kind of blocking is occurring
    //   - Get the LockOwnerOSThreadId and LockOwnerManagedThreadId property getter values. If the blocking is waiting for a
    //     lock and the lock is currently owned by a thread, one of these properties will return a nonzero value that can be
    //     used to identify the lock owner thread.
