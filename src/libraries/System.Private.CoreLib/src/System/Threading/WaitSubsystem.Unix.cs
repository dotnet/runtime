    /// # Wait subsystem
    ///
    /// ## Types
    ///
    /// <see cref="WaitSubsystem"/>
    ///   - Static API surface for dealing with synchronization objects that support multi-wait, and to put a thread into a wait
    ///     state, on Unix
    ///   - Any interaction with the wait subsystem from outside should go through APIs on this class, and should not directly
    ///     go through any of the nested classes
    ///
    /// <see cref="WaitableObject"/>
    ///   - An object that supports the features of <see cref="EventWaitHandle"/>, <see cref="Semaphore"/>, and
    ///     <see cref="Mutex"/>. The handle of each of those classes is associated with a <see cref="WaitableObject"/>.
    ///
    /// <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo"/>
    ///   - Keeps information about a thread's wait and provides functionlity to put a thread into a wait state and to take it
    ///     out of a wait state. Each thread has an instance available through <see cref="Thread.WaitInfo"/>.
    ///
    /// <see cref="HandleManager"/>
    ///   - Provides functionality to allocate a handle associated with a <see cref="WaitableObject"/>, to retrieve the object
    ///     from a handle, and to delete a handle.
    ///
    /// <see cref="LowLevelLock"/> and <see cref="LowLevelMonitor"/>
    ///   - These are "low level" in the sense they don't depend on this wait subsystem, and any waits done are not
    ///     interruptible
    ///   - <see cref="LowLevelLock"/> is used for the process-wide lock <see cref="s_lock"/>
    ///   - <see cref="LowLevelMonitor"/> is the main system dependency of the wait subsystem, and all waits are done through
    ///     it. It is backed by a C++ equivalent in CoreLib.Native's pal_threading.*, which wraps a pthread mutex/condition
    ///     pair. Each thread has an instance in <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo._waitMonitor"/>, which is used to synchronize the
    ///     thread's wait state and for waiting. <see cref="LowLevelLock"/> also uses an instance of
    ///     <see cref="LowLevelMonitor"/> for waiting.
    ///
    /// ## Design goals
    ///
    /// Behave similarly to wait operations on Windows
    ///   - The design is similar to the one used by CoreCLR's PAL, but much simpler due to there being no need for supporting
    ///     process/thread waits, or cross-process multi-waits (which CoreCLR also does not support but there are many design
    ///     elements specific to it)
    ///   - Waiting
    ///     - A waiter keeps an array of objects on which it is waiting (see <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo._waitedObjects"/>).
    ///     - The waiter registers a <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo.WaitedListNode"/> with each <see cref="WaitableObject"/>
    ///     - The waiter waits on its own <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo._waitMonitor"/> to go into a wait state
    ///     - Upon timeout, the waiter unregisters the wait and continues
    ///   - Sleeping
    ///     - Sleeping is just another way of waiting, only there would not be any waited objects
    ///   - Signaling
    ///     - A signaler iterates over waiters and tries to release waiters based on the signal count
    ///     - For each waiter, the signaler checks if the waiter's wait can be terminated
    ///     - When a waiter's wait can be terminated, the signaler does everything necesary before waking the waiter, such that
    ///       the waiter can simply continue after awakening, including unregistering the wait and assigning ownership if
    ///       applicable
    ///   - Interrupting
    ///     - Interrupting is just another way of signaling a waiting thread. The interrupter unregisters the wait and wakes the
    ///       waiter.
    ///   - Wait release fairness
    ///     - As mentioned above in how signaling works, waiters are released in fair order (first come, first served)
    ///     - This is mostly done to match the behavior of synchronization objects in Windows, which are also fair
    ///     - Events have an implicit requirement to be fair
    ///       - For a <see cref="ManualResetEvent"/>, Set/Reset in quick succession requires that it wakes up all waiters,
    ///         implying that the design cannot be to signal a thread to wake and have it check the state when it awakens some
    ///         time in the future
    ///       - For an <see cref="AutoResetEvent"/>, Set/Set in quick succession requires that it wakes up two threads, implying
    ///         that a Set/Wait in quick succession cannot have the calling thread accept its own signal if there is a waiter
    ///     - There is an advantage to being fair, as it guarantees that threads are only awakened when necessary. That is, a
    ///       thread will never wake up and find that it has to go back to sleep because the wait is not satisfied (except due
    ///       to spurious wakeups caused by external factors).
    ///   - Synchronization
    ///     - A process-wide lock <see cref="s_lock"/> is used to synchronize most operations and the signal state of all
    ///       <see cref="WaitableObject"/>s in the process. Given that it is recommended to use alternative synchronization
    ///       types (<see cref="ManualResetEventSlim"/>, <see cref="SemaphoreSlim"/>, <see cref="Monitor"/>) for single-wait
    ///       cases, it is probably not worth optimizing for the single-wait case. It is possible with a small design change to
    ///       bypass the lock and use interlocked operations for uncontended cases, but at the cost of making multi-waits more
    ///       complicated and slower.
    ///     - The wait state of a thread (<see cref="ThreadWaitInfo._waitSignalState"/>), among other things, is synchornized
    ///       using the thread's <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo._waitMonitor"/>, so signalers and interrupters acquire the monitor's
    ///       lock before checking the wait state of a thread and signaling the thread to wake up.
    ///
    /// Self-consistent in the event of any exception
    ///   - Try/finally is used extensively, including around any operation that could fail due to out-of-memory
    ///
    /// Decent balance between memory usage and performance
    ///   - <see cref="WaitableObject"/> is intended to be as small as possible while avoiding virtual calls and casts
    ///   - As <see cref="Mutex"/> is not commonly used and requires more state, some of its state is separated into
    ///     <see cref="WaitableObject._ownershipInfo"/>
    ///   - When support for cross-process objects is added, the current thought is to have an <see cref="object"/> field that
    ///     is used for both cross-process state and ownership state.
    ///
    /// No allocation in typical cases of any operation except where necessary
    ///   - Since the maximum number of wait handles for a multi-wait operation is limited to
    ///     <see cref="WaitHandle.MaxWaitHandles"/>, arrays necessary for holding information about a multi-wait, and list nodes
    ///     necessary for registering a wait, are precreated with a low initial capacity that covers most typical cases
    ///   - Threads track owned mutexes by linking the <see cref="WaitableObject.OwnershipInfo"/> instance into a linked list
    ///     <see cref="ThreadWaitInfo.LockedMutexesHead"/>. <see cref="WaitableObject.OwnershipInfo"/> is itself a list node,
    ///     and is created along with the mutex <see cref="WaitableObject"/>.
    ///
    /// Minimal p/invokes in typical uncontended cases
    ///   - <see cref="HandleManager"/> currently uses <see cref="Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle"/> in the interest of
    ///     simplicity, which p/invokes and does a cast to get the <see cref="WaitableObject"/> from a handle
    ///   - Most of the wait subsystem is written in C#, so there is no initially required p/invoke
    ///   - <see cref="LowLevelLock"/>, used by the process-wide lock <see cref="s_lock"/>, uses interlocked operations to
    ///     acquire and release the lock when there is no need to wait or to release a waiter. This is significantly faster than
    ///     using <see cref="LowLevelMonitor"/> as a lock, which uses pthread mutex functionality through p/invoke. The lock is
    ///     typically not held for very long, especially since allocations inside the lock will be rare.
    ///   - Since <see cref="s_lock"/> provides mutual exclusion for the states of all <see cref="WaitableObject"/>s in the
    ///     process, any operation that does not involve waiting or releasing a wait can occur with minimal p/invokes
