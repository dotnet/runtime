        // Design note:
        // The compiler requires a AppendFormatted overload for anything that might be within an interpolation expression;
        // if it can't find an appropriate overload, for handlers in general it'll simply fail to compile.
        // (For target-typing to string where it uses DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler implicitly, it'll instead fall back to
        // its other mechanisms, e.g. using string.Format.  This fallback has the benefit that if we miss a case,
        // interpolated strings will still work, but it has the downside that a developer generally won't know
        // if the fallback is happening and they're paying more.)
        //
        // At a minimum, then, we would need an overload that accepts:
        //     (object value, int alignment = 0, string? format = null)
        // Such an overload would provide the same expressiveness as string.Format.  However, this has several
        // shortcomings:
        // - Every value type in an interpolation expression would be boxed.
        // - ReadOnlySpan<char> could not be used in interpolation expressions.
        // - Every AppendFormatted call would have three arguments at the call site, bloating the IL further.
        // - Every invocation would be more expensive, due to lack of specialization, every call needing to account
        //   for alignment and format, etc.
        //
        // To address that, we could just have overloads for T and ReadOnlySpan<char>:
        //     (T)
        //     (T, int alignment)
        //     (T, string? format)
        //     (T, int alignment, string? format)
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>)
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>, int alignment)
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>, string? format)
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>, int alignment, string? format)
        // but this also has shortcomings:
        // - Some expressions that would have worked with an object overload will now force a fallback to string.Format
        //   (or fail to compile if the handler is used in places where the fallback isn't provided), because the compiler
        //   can't always target type to T, e.g. `b switch { true => 1, false => null }` where `b` is a bool can successfully
        //   be passed as an argument of type `object` but not of type `T`.
        // - Reference types get no benefit from going through the generic code paths, and actually incur some overheads
        //   from doing so.
        // - Nullable value types also pay a heavy price, in particular around interface checks that would generally evaporate
        //   at compile time for value types but don't (currently) if the Nullable<T> goes through the same code paths
        //   (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/50915).
        //
        // We could try to take a more elaborate approach for DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler, since it is the most common handler
        // and we want to minimize overheads both at runtime and in IL size, e.g. have a complete set of overloads for each of:
        //     (T, ...) where T : struct
        //     (T?, ...) where T : struct
        //     (object, ...)
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>, ...)
        //     (string, ...)
        // but this also has shortcomings, most importantly:
        // - If you have an unconstrained T that happens to be a value type, it'll now end up getting boxed to use the object overload.
        //   This also necessitates the T? overload, since nullable value types don't meet a T : struct constraint, so without those
        //   they'd all map to the object overloads as well.
        // - Any reference type with an implicit cast to ROS<char> will fail to compile due to ambiguities between the overloads. string
        //   is one such type, hence needing dedicated overloads for it that can be bound to more tightly.
        //
        // A middle ground we've settled on, which is likely to be the right approach for most other handlers as well, would be the set:
        //     (T, ...) with no constraint
        //     (ReadOnlySpan<char>) and (ReadOnlySpan<char>, int)
        //     (object, int alignment = 0, string? format = null)
        //     (string) and (string, int)
        // This would address most of the concerns, at the expense of:
        // - Most reference types going through the generic code paths and so being a bit more expensive.
        // - Nullable types being more expensive until https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/50915 is addressed.
        //   We could choose to add a T? where T : struct set of overloads if necessary.
        // Strings don't require their own overloads here, but as they're expected to be very common and as we can
        // optimize them in several ways (can copy the contents directly, don't need to do any interface checks, don't
        // need to pay the shared generic overheads, etc.) we can add overloads specifically to optimize for them.
        //
        // Hole values are formatted according to the following policy:
        // 1. If an IFormatProvider was supplied and it provides an ICustomFormatter, use ICustomFormatter.Format (even if the value is null).
        // 2. If the type implements ISpanFormattable, use ISpanFormattable.TryFormat.
        // 3. If the type implements IFormattable, use IFormattable.ToString.
        // 4. Otherwise, use object.ToString.
        // This matches the behavior of string.Format, StringBuilder.AppendFormat, etc.  The only overloads for which this doesn't
        // apply is ReadOnlySpan<char>, which isn't supported by either string.Format nor StringBuilder.AppendFormat, but more
        // importantly which can't be boxed to be passed to ICustomFormatter.Format.
