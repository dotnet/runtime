# System.Private.CoreLib Shared Sources

This directory contains the shared sources for System.Private.CoreLib. It represents the majority of the CoreLib implementation.  Each flavor of the runtime (e.g. coreclr, mono) provides a few additional files as part of its build of CoreLib to complement this directory's contents.
