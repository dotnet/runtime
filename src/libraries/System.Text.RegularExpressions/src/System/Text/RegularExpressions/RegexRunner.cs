// This RegexRunner class is a base class for compiled regex code.

// Implementation notes:

// It provides the driver code that call's the subclass's Go()
// method for either scanning or direct execution.
//
// It also maintains memory allocation for the backtracking stack,
// the grouping stack and the longjump crawlstack, and provides
// methods to push new subpattern match results into (or remove
// backtracked results from) the Match instance.
