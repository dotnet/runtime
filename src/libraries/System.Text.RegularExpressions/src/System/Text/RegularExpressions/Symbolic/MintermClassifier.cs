            //    affect correctness), removing the ASCII values from the BDD reduces the size of the multi-terminal BDD.
            // 2. We can check if every character now maps to the same minterm ID (the same terminal in the
            //    multi-terminal BDD).  This can be relatively common after (1) above is applied, as many
