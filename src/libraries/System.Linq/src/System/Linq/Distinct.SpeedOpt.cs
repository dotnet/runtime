    /// <summary>Provides a set of <see langword="static" /> (<see langword="Shared" /> in Visual Basic) methods for querying objects that implement <see cref="System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{T}" />.</summary>
    /// <remarks>The methods in this class provide an implementation of the standard query operators for querying data sources that implement <see cref="System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{T}" />. The standard query operators are general purpose methods that follow the LINQ pattern and enable you to express traversal, filter, and projection operations over data in any .NET-based programming language.
    /// The majority of the methods in this class are defined as extension methods that extend <see cref="System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{T}" />. This means they can be called like an instance method on any object that implements <see cref="System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{T}" />.
    /// Methods that are used in a query that returns a sequence of values do not consume the target data until the query object is enumerated. This is known as deferred execution. Methods that are used in a query that returns a singleton value execute and consume the target data immediately.</remarks>
