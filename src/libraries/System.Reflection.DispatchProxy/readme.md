# System.Reflection.DispatchProxy
Supports the [`DispatchProxy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection.dispatchproxy) class which is used to forward methods to another class.

## Status: [Legacy](../system.reflection/overview.md#status)
Although used for key scenarios by the community, it has remained relatively unchanged. Internally it uses [Emit](../System.Reflection.Emit/readme.md) to generate the proxies so it doesn't work on all platforms.

## Deployment
https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reflection.Context
