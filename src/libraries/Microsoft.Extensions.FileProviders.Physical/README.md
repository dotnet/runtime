# Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Physical
This assembly provides an implementation of a physical file provider that looks-up files from disk. It can watch for changes on disk either by using a `FileSystemWatcher` or by using polling.

The primary type is [`PhysicalFileProvider`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.fileproviders.physicalfileprovider).
