    These packages affect the design-time experience in VS, we update them
    at the same cadance as the MicrosoftCodeAnalysisVersion_LatestVS version.
    This property is set eng/Versions.props but we override it because the current
    version 4.7.0 flags several warnings that need area-owner expertise to resolve.
