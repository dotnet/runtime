    <!-- IsTool true causes the build output to be placed in the

         output. -->
    <!-- TODO: This has no effect currently, because we are using a

    <!-- We want to package the tasks package together with its
         package dependencies, the linker, and the linker's
         dependencies, in order to prevent projects that contsume the
         tasks package from pulling in the linker. To do this, we need
         to include project references and package references in the
         package, and prevent any of these references from being
         marked as dependencies in the tasks package.

         To include the linker in the package, we want to package the
         tasks project together with its project references. This is
         not supported by the pack targets
         (https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/1290,
         https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3959), so we work around
         this by explicitly setting the package path to include the
         build output. Using the publish directory will also cause
         dependencies from package references to be packaged.

         To prevent the linker from being marked as a package
         dependency, we can't use PrivateAssets="All", because this
         removes it from the publish output as well, due to an issue
         in the SDK (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/952). To
         work around this, we use a custom .nuspec that doesn't
         declare any dependencies. This also prevents package
         references from being marked as dependencies. -->

         issue is fixed. -->

  <!-- TODO: Remove this workaround once we're able to avoid using a
       custom .nuspec. We may still need a similar workaround to
       dynamically include the publish output in the package contents.

       We can't specify the output path to package in the static
       nuspec properties, because the project's output path gets set
       at a later point. To work around this, we add the output path
       to the nuspec properties dynamically as part of the pack
       target. We use the same workaround to set the version in the
       .nuspec file.

       We can't insert this into the pack target by modifying
       PackDependsOn, since GenerateNuspec is always prepended to
       PackDependsOn, which would cause the nuspec file to be
       generated before our extra properties are added.

       Instead, we use GenerateNuspecDependsOn. We could probably also
       use BeforeTargets="GenerateNuspec". -->

  <!-- We can't glob everything in the output path for two reasons:

       1. Content gets expanded before "Build" is called during
       "Pack". We could work around this by creating our own target to
       call build and then pack, but it would be nice to avoid
       changing the build/package pipeline.

       2. We'll try to include the tasks dll twice. This only causes a
       warning during pack, but should be avoided.

       <Content Include="$(OutputPath)*.dll;$(OutputPath)*.json">
         <PackagePath>tools</PackagePath>
       </Content>

       There may also be a better ItemGroup to use than
       Content. Content semantics mean to output with the build, which
       isn't our goal. Instead, we want to include these dependencies
       in the package without necessarily including them in the build.

           that shows up when trying to build from a .sln file.

           There is a nuget bug that prevents this from working
           properly during restore
           (https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4873). For the
           moment, the linker has a workaround for this issue.

           However, this still won't work properly because the build
           target doesn't propagate this information properly either -
           this is probably another bug. Building from the .csproj
           would cause cecil to be built twice, once through the
           linker with the netstandard configuration and once directly
           from the tasks project in the default configuration info
           (because some target gets its reference information from
           the lock file, which doesn't have configuration info).
