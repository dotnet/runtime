	///	IStaticAbstractMethods.Method() isn't referenced anywhere else and isn't otherwise needed.
	///	Usually the interface method could be removed, and the pointer to it in the .overrides metadata would be removed
	///	However, since OverridesStaticInterfaceMethods is in a 'copy' assembly, the .overrides metadata isn't swept. If we remove the method from the interface,
	///	we have a "dangling reference" which makes the metadata invalid.
