	/// Reproduces the issue found in https://github.com/dotnet/linker/issues/3112.
	/// <see cref="Derived1"/> derives from <see cref="Base"/> and uses <see cref="Base"/>'s method to implement <see cref="IFoo"/>, 
	/// creating a psuedo-circular assembly reference (but not quite since <see cref="Base"/> doesn't implement IFoo itself).
	/// In ILLink, IsMethodNeededByInstantiatedTypeDueToPreservedScope would iterate through <see cref="Base"/>'s method's base methods,
	/// and in the process would trigger the assembly of <see cref="IFoo"/> to be processed. Since that assembly also has <see cref="Derived2"/> that 
	/// inherits from <see cref="Base"/> and implements <see cref="IBar"/> using <see cref="Base"/>'s methods, ILLink adds 
	/// <see cref="IBar"/>'s method as a base to <see cref="Base"/>'s method, which modifies the collection as it's being iterated, causing an exception.
