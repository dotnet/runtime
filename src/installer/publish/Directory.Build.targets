    Look through the downloaded artifacts to figure out how to ship them. Creates item groups for

    DownloadDirectory is expected to have some directory inside, which then contains a dir for each
    build job name. For example, this nupkg would be found:

        missing symbols.nupkg files: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/2499.

        * NonShipping packages have symbol nupkgs that are Shipping.
