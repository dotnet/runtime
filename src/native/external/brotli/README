BROTLI DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data
using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding
and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best
currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed
with deflate but offers more dense compression.

The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932
