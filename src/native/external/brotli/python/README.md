This directory contains the code for the Python `brotli` module,
`bro.py` tool, and roundtrip tests.

Only Python 2.7+ is supported.

We provide a `Makefile` to simplify common development commands.

### Installation

If you just want to install the latest release of the Python `brotli`
module, we recommend installing from [PyPI][]:

    $ pip install brotli

Alternatively, you may install directly from source by running the
following command from this directory:

    $ make install

### Development

You may run the following commands from this directory:

    $ make          # Build the module in-place

    $ make test     # Test the module

    $ make clean    # Remove all temporary files and build output

If you wish to make the module available while still being
able to edit the source files, you can use the `setuptools`
"[development mode][]":

    $ make develop  # Install the module in "development mode"

### Code Style

Brotli's code follows the [Google Python Style Guide][].  To
automatically format your code, first install [YAPF][]:

    $ pip install yapf

Then, to format all files in the project, you can run:

    $ make fix      # Automatically format code

See the [YAPF usage][] documentation for more information.
