.SH NAME
unw_get_proc_info_by_ip
\-\- get procedure info by IP 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
#include <libunwind.h>
.br
.PP
int
unw_get_proc_info_by_ip(unw_addr_space_t as,
unw_word_t ip,
unw_proc_info_t *pip,
void *arg);
.br
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
The unw_get_proc_info_by_ip()
routine returns the same 
kind of auxiliary information about a procedure as 
unw_get_proc_info(),
except that the info is looked up by 
instruction\-pointer (IP) instead of a cursor. This is more flexible 
because it is possible to look up the info for an arbitrary procedure, 
even if it is not part of the current call chain. However, since it 
is more flexible, it also tends to run slower (and often much slower) 
than unw_get_proc_info().
.PP
The routine expects the following arguments: as
is the 
address\-space in which the instruction pointer should be looked up. 
For a look\-up in the local address\-space, 
unw_local_addr_space
can be passed for this argument. 
Argument ip
is the instruction\-pointer for which the procedure 
info should be looked up and pip
is a pointer to a structure of 
type unw_proc_info_t
which is used to return the info. 
Lastly, arg
is the address space argument that should be used 
when accessing the address space. It has the same purpose as the 
argument of the same name for unw_init_remote().
When 
accessing the local address space (first argument is 
unw_local_addr_space),
NULL
must be passed for this 
argument. 
.PP
Note that for the purposes of libunwind,
the code of a 
procedure is assumed to occupy a single, contiguous range of 
addresses. For this reason, it is always possible to describe the 
extent of a procedure with the start_ip
and end_ip
members. If a single function/routine is split into multiple, 
discontiguous pieces, libunwind
will treat each piece as a 
separate procedure. 
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE

.PP
On successful completion, unw_get_proc_info_by_ip()
returns 0. Otherwise the negative value of one of the error\-codes 
below is returned. 
.PP
.SH THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY

.PP
unw_get_proc_info_by_ip()
is thread safe. If the local 
address space is passed in argument as,
this routine is also 
safe to use from a signal handler. 
.PP
.SH ERRORS

.PP
.TP
UNW_EUNSPEC
 An unspecified error occurred. 
.TP
UNW_ENOINFO
 Libunwind
was unable to locate 
unwind\-info for the procedure. 
.TP
UNW_EBADVERSION
 The unwind\-info for the procedure has 
version or format that is not understood by libunwind\&.
.PP
In addition, unw_get_proc_info_by_ip()
may return any 
error returned by the access_mem()
callback (see 
unw_create_addr_space(3libunwind)).
