unw_get_proc_name_by_ip
\-\- get procedure name 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
#include <libunwind.h>
.br
.PP
int
unw_get_proc_name_by_ip(unw_addr_space_t as,
unw_word_t ip,
char *bufp,
size_t
len,
unw_word_t *offp,
void *arg);
.br
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
The unw_get_proc_name_by_ip()
routine returns the name of 
a procedure just like unw_get_proc_name(),
except that the 
name is looked up by instruction pointer (IP) instead of a cursor. 
.PP
The routine expects the following arguments: as
is the 
address\-space in which the instruction pointer should be looked up. 
For a look\-up in the local address\-space, 
unw_local_addr_space
can be passed for this argument. 
Argument ip
is the instruction\-pointer for which the procedure 
name should be looked up. The bufp
argument is a pointer to 
a character buffer that is at least len
bytes long. This buffer 
is used to return the name of the procedure. The offp
argument 
is a pointer to a word that is used to return the byte offset of the 
instruction\-pointer relative to the start of the procedure. 
Lastly, arg
is the address space argument that should be used 
when accessing the address space. It has the same purpose as the 
argument of the same name for unw_init_remote().
When 
accessing the local address space (first argument is 
unw_local_addr_space),
NULL
must be passed for this 
argument. 
.PP
Note that on some platforms there is no reliable way to distinguish 
between procedure names and ordinary labels. Furthermore, if symbol 
information has been stripped from a program, procedure names may be 
completely unavailable or may be limited to those exported via a 
dynamic symbol table. In such cases, 
unw_get_proc_name_by_ip()
may return the name of a label 
or a preceding (nearby) procedure. However, the offset returned 
through offp
is always relative to the returned name, which 
ensures that the value (address) of the returned name plus the 
returned offset will always be equal to the instruction pointer 
ip\&.
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE

.PP
On successful completion, unw_get_proc_name_by_ip()
returns 0. Otherwise the negative value of one of the error codes 
below is returned. 
.PP
.SH THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY

.PP
unw_get_proc_name_by_ip()
is thread safe. If the local 
address\-space is passed in argument as,
this routine is also 
safe to use from a signal handler. 
.PP
.SH ERRORS

.PP
.TP
UNW_EUNSPEC
 An unspecified error occurred. 
.TP
UNW_ENOINFO
 Libunwind
was unable to determine 
the name of the procedure. 
.TP
UNW_ENOMEM
 The procedure name is too long to fit 
in the buffer provided. A truncated version of the name has been 
returned. 
.PP
In addition, unw_get_proc_name_by_ip()
may return any error 
returned by the access_mem()
callback (see 
unw_create_addr_space(3libunwind)).
