Note: This library does not use a standard release lifecycle.
      We're pointing to the latest available tagged version as of this writing.

We do not pull in every file from the intel/zlib repo. Instead, some years ago,
somebody determined what they believed was the minimum set that needed to be
copied into our repo in order to build. Since then, we've just updated only
those files in-place, ignoring other files in the intel/zlib repo. If new files
are introduced which are necessary for building the product, feel free to bring
those down as well.
