We have removed zlib.3.pdf from our local copy, as it is a binary file which is
not needed for our compilation.

We have also cherry-picked into our local copy:

  This patch only affects memLevel 9 compression. .NET doesn't currently use this
  memLevel, but we'll take this patch out of an abundance of caution just in case
  we enable this functionality in a future release.
