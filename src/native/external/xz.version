v5.8.2
https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.8.2

To update the code in the future, follow these steps:
1. Download the source code tarball from https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/
2. Delete existing files in 'src/native/external/zstd/'
3. Extract and copy the 'lib' and 'build' directories into 'src/native/external/zstd/'
4. Build and run tests

Only the 'cmake', 'lib' and 'src' directories from the original source were included to minimize unnecessary code.
