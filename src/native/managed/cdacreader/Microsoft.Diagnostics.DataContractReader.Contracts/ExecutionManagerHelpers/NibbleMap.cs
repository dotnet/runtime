// Given a contiguous region of memory in which we lay out a collection of non-overlapping code blocks that are
// not too small (so that two adjacent ones aren't too close together) and  where the start of each code block is preceeded by a code header aligned on some power of 2,
// we can break up the whole memory space into buckets of a fixed size (32-bytes in the current implementation), where
// each bucket either has a code block header or not.
// Thinking of each code block header address as a hex number, we can view it as: [index, offset, zeros]
// where each index gives us a bucket and the offset gives us the position of the header within the bucket.
// We encode each offset into a 4-bit nibble, reserving the special value 0 to mark the places in the map where a method doesn't start.
//
// To find the start of a method given an address we first convert it into a bucket index (giving the map unit)
// and an offset which we can then turn into the index of the nibble that covers that address.
// If the nibble is non-zero, we have the start of a method and it is near the given address.
// If the nibble is zero, we have to search backward first through the current map unit, and then through previous map
// units until we find a non-zero nibble.
//
// For example (all code addresses are relative to some unspecified base):
//  Suppose there is code starting at address 304 (0x130)
//  Then the map index will be 304 / 32 = 9 and the byte offset will be 304 % 32 = 16
//  Because addresses are 4-byte aligned, the nibble value will be 1 + 16 / 4 = 5  (we reserve 0 to mean no method).
//  So the map unit containing index 9 will contain the value 0x5 << 24 (the map index 9 means we want the second nibble in the second map unit, and we number the nibbles starting from the most significant)
//  Or 0x05000000
//
//  Now suppose we do a lookup for address 306 (0x132)
//  The map index will be 306 / 32 = 9 and the byte offset will be 306 % 32 = 18
//  The nibble value will be 1 + 18 / 4 = 5
//  To do the lookup, we will load the map unit with index 9 (so the second 32-bit unit in the map) and get the value 0x05000000
//  We will then shift to focus on the nibble with map index 9 (which again has nibble shift 24), so
//  the map unit will be 0x00000005 and we will get the nibble value 5.
//  Therefore we know that there is a method start at map index 9, nibble value 5.
//  The map index corresponds to an offset of 288 bytes and the nibble value 5 corresponds to an offset of (5 - 1) * 4 = 16 bytes
//  So the method starts at offset 288 + 16 = 304, which is the address we were looking for.
//
//  Now suppose we do a lookup for address 302 (0x12E)
//  The map index will be 302 / 32 = 9 and the byte offset will be 302 % 32 = 14
//  The nibble value will be 1 + 14 / 4 = 4
//  To do the lookup, we will load the map unit containing map index 9 and get the value 0x05000000
//  We will then shift to focus on the nibble with map index 9 (which again has nibble shift 24), so we will get
//  the nibble value 5.
//  Therefore we know that there is a method start at map index 9, nibble value 5.
//  But the address we're looking for is map index 9, nibble value 4.
//  We know that methods can't start within 32-bytes of each other, so we know that the method we're looking for is not in the current nibble.
//  We will then try to shift to the previous nibble in the map unit (0x00000005 >> 4 = 0x00000000)
//  Therefore we know there is no method start at any map index in the current map unit.
//  We will then align the map index to the start of the current map unit (map index 8) and move back to the previous map unit (map index 7)
//  At that point, we scan backwards for non-zero map units. Since there are none, we return null.
