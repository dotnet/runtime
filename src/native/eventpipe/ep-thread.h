	// An array of slots to hold per-session per-thread state.
	// A slot in this array should be non-NULL iff the same ThreadSessionState object is also contained in the
	// session->buffer_manager->thread_session_state_list.
	//
	// Thread-safety notes:
	// The pointers in this array are only modified under the buffer manager lock for whichever enabled session currently owns the slot.
	// (session->index == slot_index)
	// Both the per-thread slots here and the global slots in _ep_sessions can only be non-NULL during the time period when the
	// session is enabled. ep_disable() won't exit the global EP lock until all the slots for that session are NULL and
	// threads have exited code regions where they may have been using locally cached pointers retrieved through
	// the slots. This ensures threads neither retain stale pointers to a disabled session, nor will they be able to acquire a
	// stale pointer from the slot later. It also means no thread will be trying to synchronize using a stale session lock across
	// the transition when a new session takes over ownership of the slot.
	//
	// Writing a non-NULL pointer into the slot only occurs on the OS thread associated with this EventPipeThread object when
	// trying to write the first event into a session.
	// Writing a NULL pointer into the slot could occur on either:
	// 1. The thread owning this EventPipeThread when it unregisters (currently this doesn't happen, but it should in the future).
	// 2. The session event flushing thread when is has finished flushing all the events for a thread that already exited.
	// 3. The thread which calls ep_disable() to disable the session.
	// 
	// Reading from this slot can either be done by taking the buffer manager lock, or by doing a volatile read of the pointer. The volatile
	// read should only occur when running on the OS thread associated with this EventPipeThread object. When reading under the lock the
	// pointer should not be retained past the scope of the lock. When using the volatile read, the pointer should not be retained
	// outside the period where writing_event_in_process == slot_number.
