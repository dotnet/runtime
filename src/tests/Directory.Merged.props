    <!--
      We need to rewrite the assembly name for some tests in merged groups:
      1. Merged test groups require consistency between the various names of tests in order
         to reference them properly.
      2. IL tests specify the assembly name explicitly in the source file via
         ".assembly" lines.
      3. Several tests can use the same IL file but build it with different command line
         options (_il_d vs _il_r).

      Note that C# tests (which may have _d, _do, _r, and _do variants) do not require this
      because the assembly name is not embedded in the source file.

      An alternative to the renaming here would be to build the different IL variants with
      different assembly names. Unfortunately, this isn't supported from the command line.
      One possible option would be to create an IL source file with something like
        #define ASSEMBLY_NAME "TESTNAME_il_d"
      and add it to the _beginning_ of the IL source list (ilasm concatenates all source
      files). Then change the test to include ".assembly ASSEMBLY_NAME".
    -->
    <!--
      Note that because this file is included from Directory.Build.props (processed before
      the main project file for a test), the project file can override this.
      Directory.Build.targets is typically too late as SDK .targets files will have already
      been processed and may have used the value.
