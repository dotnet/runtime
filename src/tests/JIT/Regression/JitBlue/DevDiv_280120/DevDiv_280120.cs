// This test was originally a repro for an assertion regarding incorrect lclVar ref counts due to a bug in the
// decomposition of a long-typed st.lclFld node. The repro requires that a dead store of this type survives until
// decomposition. We must therefore avoid running liveness before decomposition as part of this test, which requires
// skipping SSA (and dependent optimizations). This pass is disabled in the project file by setting JitDoSsa to 0
// before running the test.
