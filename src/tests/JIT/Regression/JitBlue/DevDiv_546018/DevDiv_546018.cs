// This tests an interop call (resulting in RETURNTRAP in its epilog)
// when there are live 256 bit values at the callsite.
// The bug was that codegen for RETURNTRAP node requested a single temp register
// and asserted that there was only one. In this case the set of temp registers
// includes floating-point registers that may be needed for saving/restoring the upper
// part of 256-bit registers. The fix was for codegen to request a single temp int register
// and assert that there was only one.
