// The bug captured by this test was a case where:
// - We have a double register pair that was previous occupied by a double lclVar.
// - That lclVar becomes dead, but has subsequent references, so it remains as the
//   previousInterval on the RegRecord.
// - The first float half is then assigned to another lclVar. It is live across a
//   loop backedge, so it is live at the end of the loop, but is then released before
//   the next block is allocated.
// - At this time, the double lclVar is restored to that RegRecord (as inactive), but
//   the loop over the lclVars sees only the second half, and asserts because it doesn't
//   expect to ever encounter an interval in the second half (it should have been skipped).
