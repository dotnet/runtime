// This test ensures that the value number store (and its users) behave properly in the event that VN data is requested
// for trees without value numbers. The original repro was a rather large method with a significant amount of dead code
// due to the pattern exhibited in C.N: an entry block that was not transformed from a conditional return to an
// unconditional return followed by dead code that must be kept due to the presence of EH. Value numbering does not
// assign value numbers to the dead code, but assertion prop still runs over the dead code and attempts to use VN info,
// which resulted in a number of asserts.
