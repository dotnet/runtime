// This test exercises expression folding in the place of overflowing operations. The original failure was SBCG due to
// an incorrect application of the same: in the program below, the checked int -> ulong cast on line 24 was folded to a
// long -> ulong cast with an incorrect constant value that fit in a ulong, resulting in no overflow exception being
// thrown.
