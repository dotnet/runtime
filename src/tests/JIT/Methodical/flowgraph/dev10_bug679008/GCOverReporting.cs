/*
 * If using a value type/struct that contains only a single reference type field, under certain situations the x64 JIT reports the stack location as a live GC pointer before zero-initializing it.
 * The only workaround would be to disable optimizations via MethodImplOptions.NoOptimization.  This GC hole is sort of an existing one and sort of a regression.
 * In one sense, it has been in the JIT since we turned on candidates and made worse with OPT_WITH_EH (since it adds a lot of cases where we try and then undo worthless register candidates), which was done between beta2 and RTM of Whidbey/2.0.
 * Previously bugs in this area caused the stackâ€™s lifetime to not get reported at all.
 * Earlier this year 2 bugs were fixed, and recently I ported those fixes to arrowhead, so that we now correctly report the untracked stack lifetime of these value types.
 * This bug is a manifestation of the opposite problem where the reference pointer is reported, but not initialized.
 * Thus depending upon the previous stack contents, can cause an inverse-GCHole (reporting of a non-GC pointer as a GC pointer).
 * This is not as serious because it is *not* the normal GC hole that leads to type system hole that leads to security exploit.
 * The worst this could cause is an AV in the runtime which would trigger an ExecutionException which I believe cannot be caught, so it would just tear down the process and hopefully invoke Watson.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * 2
 * 3
 * 5
 * 6
 * 8
 * 9
 *
 * Actual output:
 * 2
 * 3
 * and then a crash!
