      These tests are incompatible with NativeAOT due to a limitation in record-trace.
      
      record-trace uses perfmap/doublemapper to discover .NET process PIDs and their diagnostic ports.
      NativeAOT apps do not use doublemapping, so they will not be discovered by record-trace even with TMPDIR set.
      See https://github.com/microsoft/one-collect/issues/226 for details.
