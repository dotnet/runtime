    Treat these tests as merged test runners.
    Many of these NativeAOT tests need to be their own executables to validate specific features,
    but we want to run them on mobile platforms as well.
    However, mobile platforms don't support tests that require process isolation, so we can't use RequiresProcessIsolation.
    Instead, we treat these tests as merged test runners themselves, so that they can run on mobile platforms.
