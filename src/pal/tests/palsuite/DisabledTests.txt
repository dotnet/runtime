Disabled Test Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a list of all disabled test cases currently listed in
testconfig.dat and an explanation as to why they are disabled.

debug_api/debugbreak/test1
debug_api/outputdebugstringa/test1
debug_api/outputdebugstringw/test1
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test1
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test2
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test3
debug_api/writeprocessmemory/test4
=======================================
The above testcases were disabled in the palsuite, because they depend heavily on
WaitForDebugEvent,DebugActiveProcess and ContinueDebugEvent, where these api's have been removed from the PAL and listed in the rotor_pal.doc (6.0)


file_io/gettempfilenamea/test2 :
=======================================
This test takes longer than 60 seconds to run. The test creates
about 65000 files and then deletes them. The test that takes longer
than 60 seconds will be flagged as an error and so in such a case
the test will have to be run manually.

file_io/gettempfilenamew/test2 :
=======================================
This test takes longer than 60 seconds to run. The test creates
about 65000 files and then deletes them. The test that takes longer
than 60 seconds will be flagged as an error and so in such a case
the test will have to be run manually.

locale_info/getcpinfo/test2:
=======================================
This test will be useful in future versions for testing various
languages (code pages).  Currently only U.S. English (tested by -
test1) is supported.

locale_info/getcpinfo/test3:
=======================================
This test will be useful in future versions for testing various
languages (code pages).  Currently only U.S. English (tested by -
test1) is supported.

locale_info/isvalidcodepage/test2:
=======================================
This test will be useful in future versions for testing various
languages (code pages).  Currently only U.S. English (tested by -
test1) is supported.

miscellaneous/getcalendarinfow/test2:
=======================================
Currently the only calendars that are supported are CAL_GREGORIAN
and CAL_GREGORIAN_US, which are tested by test1.  This test will
be useful when full calendar support is implemented.

miscellaneous/getdateformatw/test1:
===================================
Currently the only calendars that are supported are CAL_GREGORIAN
and CAL_GREGORIAN_US.  The GetDateFormatW function will only be 
called when the calendar is CAL_TAIWAN. Since this calendar is not
currently supported in this release of the PAL, the GetDateFormatW
function is not implemented except to return an error. This test
will be useful when full calendar support is implemented.

miscellaneous/getdateformatw/getdateformatw_neg1:
================================================
Currently the only calendars that are supported are CAL_GREGORIAN
and CAL_GREGORIAN_US.  The GetDateFormatW function will only be 
called when the calendar is CAL_TAIWAN. Since this calendar is not
currently supported in this release of the PAL, the GetDateFormatW
function is not implemented except to return an error. This test
will be useful when full calendar support is implemented.

miscellaneous/getdateformatw/getdateformatw_neg2:
================================================
Currently the only calendars that are supported are CAL_GREGORIAN
and CAL_GREGORIAN_US.  The GetDateFormatW function will only be 
called when the calendar is CAL_TAIWAN. Since this calendar is not
currently supported in this release of the PAL, the GetDateFormatW
function is not implemented except to return an error. This test
will be useful when full calendar support is implemented.


networking/accept_connect/connect_neg1
=======================================
Currently disable, since there is a discrepancy between what is documented in
MSDN and the rotor_pal.doc. Connection of a datagram socket to a broadcast
address should return an error, yet under WIN32 and FreeBSD, there is no error.

networking/accept_connect/connect_neg6
networking/accept_connect/connect_neg9
=======================================
PAL specifications now dictate that a pass for this test is not required.


networking/gethostbyname/gethostbyname_neg2
=======================================
These test are temporarily disabled because they hang when executed under
Windows.


networking/send_recv/send_neg5
networking/send_recv/sendto_neg6
networking/wsasend_wsarecv/wsasend4
networking/wsasendto_wsarecvfrom/wsasendto5
===========================================
Calling send after shutdown on a given socket raises an unhandled SIGPIPE
signal in FreeBSD 4.4 and FreeBSD 4.5. Microsoft confirmed they could
live with that problem, so these tests are not required.



networking/send_recv/send_neg6
=======================================
PAL specifications now dictate that a pass for this test is not required.


networking/send_recv/send_neg7(Bug #1722)
=======================================
Currently disable, since there is a discrepancy between what is documented in
MSDN and the rotor_pal.doc. Send with MSG_OOB flag with socket option 
SO_OOBINLINE enabled should return an error, yet under WIN32 and FreeBSD, 
there is no error.

networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_neg7(Bug #1723)
=======================================
Currently disable, since there is a discrepancy between what is documented in
MSDN and the rotor_pal.doc. Sendto with a non-blocking socket should return
and error, yet under WIN32 and FreeBSD, there is no error.

networking/sendto_recvfrom/recvfrom_neg7
networking/sendto_recvfrom/recvfrom_neg10
networking/sendto_recvfrom/recvfrom_neg11
networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_neg2
networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_neg3
networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_neg5
networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_neg8
networking/sendto_recvfrom/sendto_recvfrom2
networking/socket/socket_neg4
=========================================
PAL specifications now dictate that a pass for these tests is not required.

networking/wsasend_wsarecv/wsasendrecv1
=========================================
Disabling this test because it is severely crippling our FreeBSD test
macines. Bug 1791 covers this issue and the test is being moved into
the severebug.dat file. dm

networking/wsasocketw/test5
networking/wsasocketw/test7
========================================
Currently disabled, since there is a difference in the validation order of
socket()'s parameters between WIN32 and FREEBSD (implies a wrong last error code).
In rotor_pal.doc, that difference is tolerated.


pal_specific/pal_get_stdin/test1 :
=======================================
This test case should be run manually.  Requires user input.


threading/setconsolectrlhandler/test1
threading/setconsolectrlhandler/test2
threading/setconsolectrlhandler/test3
threading/setconsolectrlhandler/test4
=======================================
These tests cases should be run manually.  Requires user input.


networking/gethostbyaddr/gethostbyaddr_neg2
=======================================
This test case is written according to the MSDN doc: testing gethostbyaddr
with an invalid type, an error WSAEAFNOSUPPORT is expected, the test result is:
no error occured with PAL library.
no error occured with win32 base library.

networking/gethostbyaddr/gethostbyaddr_neg3
=======================================
This test case is written according to the MSDN doc: testing gethostbyaddr
with a small len parameter, an error WSAEFAULT is expected, the test result is:
no error occured with PAL library 
and correct hostent struct data is retrieved 

no error occured with win32 base library 
and correct hostent struct data is retrieved


networking/closesocket/closesocket_neg3
=======================================
This test case is written according to the MSDN doc: testing closesocket to 
close a non-blocking stream socket with SO_LINGER setting to a nonzero 
time-out value, an error WSAEWOULDBLOCK is expected, the test result is:

no error occured with PAL library 

no error occured with win32 base library 


networking/send_recv/recv_neg7
=======================================
This test case is designd according to MSDN, test recv API by passing a
smaller buf size, the revceiving data will be truncated and an error
WSAEMSGSIZE will be detected. the test result is:

link to PAL library. No error is detected and data is truncated.

link to Win32 base library. No error is detected and data is truncated.

So, Windows 2000 is assumed right, and disable this negative test case


networking/accept_connect/connect_neg11
=======================================
This test case is designd according to MSDN, test connect API to connect 
a broadcast address with setting this socket option as broadcast, an error
WSAEACCESS is expected, the test result is:

link to PAL library. No error is detected

link to Win32 base library. No error is detected 

So, Windows 2000 is assumed right, and disable this negative test case

networking/sendto_recvfrom/recvfrom_neg8
networking/send_recv/recv_neg5
=======================================
In Windows recv, recvfrom and WSARecv will return WSAESHUTDOWN when the 
connection has been shutdown, in BSD recv return 0 bytes read with no error 
when the connection has been shutdown. This difference is considered as 
acceptable.

networking/send_recv/recv_neg10
=======================================
On win32, depending on the value returned by recv(), 0 or -1, we can distinguish
between a *graceful* (0) and *abortive* (-1) socket  remote closure.
Unfortunately on bsd, there's no way to distinguish between the two cases, 
in fact, recv returns 0, with no error, for both *graceful* and *abortive* closure.
This difference is considered as acceptable (similar to the issue when recv() 
called after shutdown()).

threading/getprocesstimes/test1
=======================================
According to rotor_pal.doc, GetProcessTimes() should be supported for the current 
process only. I've removed this test because it tests GetProcessTimes() with 
invalid process handle value.

threading/getthreadcontext/test1,1
=======================================
According to rotor_pal.doc, when GetThreadContext is call for a thread within 
the same process, it could only be called for te current thread. I've removed
this test, because it tests GetThreadContext() with a non current thread handle 
belong the current procees.

loader/loadlibrarya/test4
loader/loadlibraryw/test4
=======================================
PAL BSD should not append the .so extension in LoadLibrary if the extension is 
omitted.
file_io/deletefilea/test3
file_io/deletefilew/test3
=======================================
No code in Rotor depends on DeleteFile[A/W] failing on readonly files so we 
don't need to exactly emulate this feature of the Win32 filesystems on FreeBSD.

networking/select/select5,0
=======================================
This is a difference between Windows & FreeBSD : in FreeBSD, no socket 
exceptions are reported for a failed connection. No code in Rotor depends on 
the Windows behavior, and it has been decided that the networking API should 
be as thin a layer as possible over the native implementation. Managed apps 
will have to take such differences into account.
