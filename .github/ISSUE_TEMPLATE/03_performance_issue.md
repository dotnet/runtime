### Description

<!--
* Please share a clear and concise description of the performance problem.
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to run it.
  -->

### Configuration

<!--
(If you are posting Benchmark.NET results, this info will be included.)
* Which version of .NET is the code running on?
* What OS version, and what distro if applicable?
* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?
* If relevant, what are the specs of the machine?
  -->

### Regression?

<!--
* Is this a regression from a previous build or release of .NET Core, or from .NET Framework? If you can try a previous release or build to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don't know, that's OK.
  -->

### Data

<!--
* Please include any benchmark results, images of graphs, timings or measurements, or callstacks that are relevant.
* If possible please include text as text rather than images (so it shows up in searches).
* If applicable please include before and after measurements.
* There is helpful information about measuring code in this repo [here](https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/docs/benchmarking-workflow-dotnet-runtime.md).
  -->

### Analysis

<!--
* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.
* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.
* If you don't know, you can delete this section.
