description: >-
  When the Azure Pipelines PR build (`runtime`) fails, downloads the binary
  logs from its failed or canceled jobs — it does NOT rebuild — and delegates
  to the `build-failure-analyst` agent, which queries the binlogs live via the
  containerized `binlog-mcp` MCP server to identify root causes, post a PR
  comment summarizing them, and attach inline `suggestion` blocks tied to the
  diff.

# This workflow is **advisory**, not gating, and it performs **no build of its
# own**. Runtime's authoritative PR build runs on Azure DevOps
# (dnceng-public/public, pipeline "runtime", definitionId 129) and publishes
# each build job's binary log in a `Logs_Build_<leg>` pipeline artifact. When
# that build's GitHub check reports failure, this workflow uses the Azure
# DevOps timeline to select the artifacts for failed or canceled jobs
# (anonymously — dnceng-public/public is a public project), then the agent
# analyses whichever selected leg(s) contain errors. Reusing the binlogs avoids
# a duplicate build: the analysis pipeline only downloads build artifacts
# (data) and reads them — it does **not** build or execute PR code. (gh-aw's
# generated agent job **does** check out the repository — via
# `actions/checkout` — to load the workflow's own agent configuration; that
# checkout is for tooling only and uses the event's ref, **not** the PR head,
# so no PR code is built or executed.)

on:
  # `check_run` fires for every check on a commit, so the `fetch-binlog` job
  # below filters tightly to the `runtime` build check reporting failure.
  check_run:
    types: [completed]
  # Advisory analysis should run for **every** failing PR — including external
  # contributors' PRs, which are the most likely to break the build. Disable
  # gh-aw's default author-association gate (which would otherwise skip
  # non-write-access actors, and on `check_run` the actor is the pipeline app
  # anyway). This is safe here: the workflow only reads a public binlog and
  # posts advisory comments — it never builds or executes PR code.
